      "description": "Peracetic acid (PAA) is utilized as an industrial disinfectant for cleaning and sterilization of water infrastructure, food-safe machinery, surgical implements, and more. PAA typically exists as a mixture with hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, water, and oxygen. These PAA cleaning solutions have been increasingly implemented in occupational settings due to their environmentally friendly decomposition products but the strong oxidative potential that allows them to effectively sanitize surfaces also underlies their ability to damage human airways. PAA mixtures are regarded as an asthmagen and occupational exposure has been associated with acute asthma-like symptoms such as airway and mucosal irritation, cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. To evaluate the broad effects of PAA vapor exposure to human bronchial cells in vitro, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and exposures were conducted to PAA vapors during a four-hour exposure window at four concentrations: 0, 3, 12, and 24 ppm. Cells were allowed to recover for four and twenty-four hours to capture a spectrum of post-exposure response. Data was gathered for cytotoxicity, viability, cell layer integrity (via transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and qualitative histological observations), and protein response for proinflammatory mediators Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8).",

      "description": "Solid surface composites (SSCs) are a widely used construction material that can generate dust and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) during fabrication. Exposure to SSC dust has been linked to pulmonary health effects, including pulmonary fibrosis and lung inflammation. Previous studies have investigated the toxicity of SSC particles using in vitro and in vivo models, but these studies have limitations. For example, they often relied on pre-generated particles that may not accurately represent the size distribution and characteristics of aerosols encountered in real-world settings. Additionally, these models did not capture the co-exposure to VOCs that can occur during SSC fabrication.\nTo address these limitations, we developed a novel apparatus capable of real-time generation of SSC sawing particles and their simultaneous delivery to rodents via whole-body inhalation. This approach allows for a more accurate assessment of SSC toxicity under conditions that better reflect workplace exposure scenarios. The present study utilizes this system to characterize the acute pulmonary response in mice following a 4-day inhalation exposure to real-time generated SSC aerosols, with evaluations at 1, 6, 27, and 56 days post-exposure.",

      "description": "Supplemental air filtration can reduce indoor exposure to hazardous aerosols without requiring modifications to building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Portable air cleaners were widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they can have drawbacks including noise, space obstruction, and electrical cord safety considerations. Built-in air filtration units are an alternative to provide supplemental air filtration. We conducted a case study of a HEPA air filtration unit installed in the ceiling of a conference room using radial laminar flow or square cone ceiling air supply diffusers. A respiratory aerosol simulator exhaled aerosol particles (0.3 to 10 \u00b5m), and the particle concentrations were measured in the personal breathing zones of three breathing simulators representing a speaker and two meeting participants. For the speaker, using one square cone supply diffuser reduced inhalation exposure by 49% to 81% while using two square supply diffusers reduced exposure by 68% to 93%. For the participants, the exposures were reduced by 23% to 64% with one square supply diffuser and 58% to 86% with two square supply diffusers. Results when using the radial supply air diffusers were more variable and more dependent on the simulator layouts. Combining the use of cloth face masks on all simulators with the ceiling unit reduced the speaker\u2019s exposure by 87% to 99% and the participants\u2019 exposures by 84% to 97%. In most cases the ceiling air filtration unit provided protection against simulated respiratory aerosol particles comparable to that seen previously with portable air cleaners.",

We conducted experiments in the facility to ensure a controlled environment, which was required to determine the quantity of PM2.5 generated during poultry slaughtering and defeathering. To ensure consistency across slaughtering and defeathering activities, we hired three LBM workers, who followed the same slaughtering and defeathering steps as in the LBMs and used the same equipment, including knives, barrels and defeathering machines. The team also conducted a survey from February to March 2018 using a semi-structured observation form in all shops (N=716) of all retail LBMs (N=35) in Dhaka city consisting of at least 10 shops. During the survey, they collected data on various equipment used for containing slaughtered poultry during exsanguination and mechanical defeathering, average weight of slaughtered broiler chickens, and average temperature of hot water used for scalding. Additionally, the team measured breathing heights of randomly selected 20 adult workers, who conducted slaughtering and defeathering, from three conveniently selected LBMs.",

Some glove manufacturers have recently marketed their gloves claiming fentanyl protection. There is limited empirical PPE performance data for opioids, and no industry standard or test method currently exists for evaluating PPE performance against opioids.

While knee-saving interventions like knee savers (KSs) and knee pads (KPs) have shown potential to reduce MSD risks, their effectiveness across different phases of shingle installation remains unknown. The objective of this study is to assess how interventions of KSs and KPs alleviate risks of MSDs in the knees during various phases of shingle installation. These phases encompass (1) reaching for shingles, (2) placing shingles, (3) grabbing a nail gun, (4) moving to the first nailing position, (5) nailing shingles, (6) replacing the nail gun, and (7) returning to an upright position. To collect data, nine male participants simulated the shingle installation task on a slope-adjustable roof platform (0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 30\u00b0 slopes) under four intervention conditions: no intervention (NO), with KPs only (KP), with KSs only (KS), and with both KPs and KSs (BO) in a laboratory setting.

      "description": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a passive back-support exoskeleton on the physical demands of caregivers during bed-to-chair patient handling tasks. Eight participants (5 males and 3 females) performed 4 different patient handling tasks, including 1) lying to sitting, 2) sitting to standing, 3) standing to sitting, and 4) bed to wheelchair transfer with and without the exoskeleton. In certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks, the exoskeleton (Laevo V2.5) was found to significantly reduce the peak and median values of the hip flexion angles and muscle activities of erector spinae compared to no exoskeleton. The effect of the exoskeleton was task-dependent. The exoskeleton caused a greater reduction of the erector spinae muscle activities of symmetric exertions than the asymmetric exertions. With the exoskeleton, participants adjusted their patient handling strategies by decreasing the hip flexion but increasing the trunk extension. There was a lack of significant changes in the heart rate with the exoskeleton.  The results suggest that back-support exoskeletons could play a role in reducing the muscular demand of the low back during certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks. However, further research would be needed to fully assess its effectiveness and practicality in improving patient-handling techniques.",

In mice, exogenous administration of chemerin or RvE1 diminishes the severity of lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) induced by antigen sensitization and challenge, which mimics phenotypic features of atopic asthma in humans.  However, the contribution of chemerin or RvE1 to features of non-atopic asthma is unknown.  Therefore, to indirectly assess if chemerin or RvE1 facilitates development of a non-atopic asthma phenotype, which includes AHR to acetyl-\u03b2-methylcholine chloride, lung hyperpermeability, airway epithelial cell desquamation, and lung inflammation, we quantified features of these sequelae in wild-type mice and mice failing to express CMKLR1 (CMKLR1-deficient mice) following cessation of acute inhalation exposure to either filtered room air or ozone, a criteria pollutant and non-atopic asthma stimulus.",

      "description": "Diesel exhaust (DE) is an air pollutant containing gaseous compounds and particulate matter.  Diesel engines are common on gas extraction and oil sites, leading to complex DE exposure to a broad range of compounds through occupational settings.  The US EPA concluded that short-term exposure to DE leads to allergic inflammatory disorders of the airways.  To further evaluate the immunotoxicity of DE, the effects of whole-body inhalation of 0.2 and 1 mg/m3 DE (total carbon; 6 h/d for 4 days) were investigated 1-, 7-, and 27-days post exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats using an occupationally relevant exposure system.  DE exposure of 1 mg/m3 increased total cellularity, number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells at 1 d post-exposure in the lung lymph nodes.  At 7 d post-exposure to 1 mg/m3, cellularity and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells decreased in the LLNs.  In the bronchoalveolar lavage, B-cell number and frequency increased at 1 d post-exposure, Natural Killer cell number and frequency decreased at 7 d post-exposure, and at 27 d post-exposure CD8+ T-cell and CD11b+ cell number and frequency decreased with 0.2 mg/m3 exposure.  In the spleen, 0.2 mg/m3 increased CD4+ T-cell frequency at 1 and 7 d post-exposure and at 27 d post-exposure increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell number and CD8+ T-cell frequency.  B-cells were the only immune cell subset altered in the three tissues (spleen, LLNs, and BALF), suggesting the induction of the adaptive immune response.  The increase in lymphocytes in several different organ types also suggests an induction of a systemic inflammatory response occurring following DE exposure.  These results show that DE exposure induced modifications of cellularity of phenotypic subsets that may impair immune function and contribute to airway inflammation induced by DE exposure in rats.",

      "description": "Inhalation exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) during fabrication of engineered stone-based kitchen countertops has been on the rise in recent years and has become a significant occupational health problem in the United States and globally. Little is known about the presence of nano-crystalline silica (NCS), i.e., particles below 100 nm. We present a methodology to quantify the crystalline silica content in the sub-100 nm size fraction of the aerosol released during engineered stone fabrication using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Aerosol was generated in test chamber designed per EN 1093-3 and sampled using cascade impactors. XRD and FT-IR analysis showed the presence of both \u03b1-quartz (15 \u2013 60 %) and cristobalite (10 \u2013 50 %) polymorphs in all size fractions. With increasing particle size, the cristobalite content increased. 70 % of the total aerosol mass in the sub-100 nm fraction was found to be crystalline silica, qualitatively confirmed by electron diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Presence of other minerals was detected in all size fractions; no polymeric resin binder was detected in the sub-100 nm fraction. Although, the sub-100 nm fraction was about 1 % of the aerosol mass, it accounted for 4 \u2013 24 % of the aerosol surface area based on total lung deposition. If the surface area is a more relevant exposure metric, the assessment of efficacy of current engineering control systems using mass as an exposure metric may not provide adequate protection.",

      "description": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a disorder experienced by one-third of the veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War, with symptoms including fatigue, chronic pain, respiratory and memory problems. Exposure to toxic chemicals during the war, such as oil well fire smoke, pesticides, physiological stress, and nerve agents, is thought to have triggered abnormal neuroinflammatory responses that contribute to GWI. Previous studies using animal models have indicated that combined exposure to high physiological stress and GW-relevant organophosphates, such as sarin nerve agent and chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, produces neuroinflammation and changes in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, suggesting a neuroimmune basis for GWI. In the current study, we examined brain structure and immune function of a chronic rat model of GWI and showed that a combination of long-term corticosterone treatment (CORT, to mimic high physiological stress) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate exposure (DFP, to mimic sarin exposure) resulted in elevations of multiple inflammatory cytokines, an increased activated microglial population, and disrupted brain microstructure in the hippocampal regions. Moreover, prior exposures to these agents modeling the \u201cin-theater,\u201d initiating exposure conditions experienced by veterans with GWI can induce long-term alterations in neuroimmune signaling, resulting in an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to future immune challenges.  The goal of the study was to establish a long-term model of GWI in rats that would be more relevant to the current state of ill veterans.  As such, rats were initially exposed to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) for 1 week followed by a single exposure to the sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, to mimic \u201cin-theater\u201d conditions of high physiological stress and nerve agent exposure.  This initial exposure was followed up with 4 weeks of intermittent re-exposure to week-long bouts of CORT and a final exposure to the prototypical inflammagen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a systemic inflammatory challenge.",

      "description": "Introduction: Thermal spray, in general, is a process that involves forcing a melted substance, such as metal or ceramic in the form of wire or powder, onto the surface of a targeted object to enhance its desired surface properties. In this paper, the melted substance is metal wire generated by an electric arc and forcibly coated on a rotary iron substrate using compressed air. This thermal process is referred to as double-wire arc thermal spray. The particles generated through these methods fall within the nanometer to micrometer agglomerate size range. There is concern regarding potential human health outcomes as these particles exhibit a similarity in particle morphology to welding fumes. Thermal spray wires with Zn (PMET540), Fe and Cr (PMET731), and Ni (PMET885) as primary metal compositions were used to generate particulate via an electric arc wire thermal spray generator for exposure to human bronchial cells (BEAS-2B) to examine comparative toxicity ranging from 0-200 \u00b5g/mL. Resulting cellular viability was assessed through live cell counts, and percent cytotoxicity was measured as a function of LDH release. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and alteration in Total Antioxidant Capacity were evaluated through DNA damage (COMET analysis) and antioxidant concentration at 0, 3.125, 25, and 100 \u00b5g/mL. Protein markers for Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were also assessed to determine inflammation and endothelial alteration.",

All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all \u201cPatients using their own eggs\u201d or for \u201cPatients with no prior ART using their own eggs.\u201d For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent\u2019s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer.

      "description": "Nickel is one of the most common contact allergens worldwide. Despite this prevalence, many of the underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for nickel allergy remain unclear. This knowledge gap is partially attributable to the inherent resistance of laboratory rodents (mice and rats) to dermal sensitization with nickel salts. The fundamental goal of this study was to assess the potential utility of the novel humanized Toll-like receptor-4 (hTLR-4) mouse model for use in future in vivo studies of nickel allergy. Accordingly, hTLR-4 positive and negative mice of both sexes were first incorporated into a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) to evaluate dermal sensitization following topical exposure to soluble nickel salts (NiSO4). The ensuing immune responses were then characterized further by incorporating female and male hTLR-4 positive mice into a non-radioactive endpoint-based assay. Utilizing the same exposure scheme as in the LLNA, mice were euthanized following exposure and the auricular lymph nodes, spleen, and blood were collected to assess various immunological parameters associated with allergy and ACD.",

      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "Masonry work, a sub-specialty of the construction industry, consists of brick and block-laying. Masonry workers often perform these tasks daily using an elevated work platform (e.g., mast climbers). Mast climbers are elevating equipment used to replace traditional scaffolds. They have been available in the United States since the 1980s.  Mast climbers are capable of handling much greater loads of workers and materials than traditional scaffolding. They also make reaching greater heights much easier, thereby improving efficiency on construction projects. However, working on an unstable work platform at elevation can increase the risks of slips, trips and falls, including falls to a lower level. From 1990 to 2017, there were a total of 35 recorded fatalities associated with the use of mast climbers. Of the 35 fatalities, 13 were masonry workers (OSHA report).  Additionally, working on a mast climber can also create awkward working postures due to the confined nature of the workspace. Masonry work can be physically demanding. Concrete block can weigh between 9-27 kg. The rate of overexertion among masonry workers was 33.4 per 10,000 FTEs compared to the average rate of 21.5 per 10,000 FTEs in all industries (BLS data). Shoulder-assist exoskeletons present an attractive possibility to reduce MSD risks in masonry workers if the exoskeletons do not cause adverse effects to the workers\u2019 stability and balance. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated effects of three models of passive shoulder-assist exoskeletons on balance and shoulder muscle activity during a masonry task on a simulated mast climbing work platform. The balance-related parameters and shoulder muscle activities were compared when using or not using the exoskeletons. We want to evaluate the hypotheses that the exoskeletons (1) reduce shoulder muscle activity and (2) decrease the stability of the workers.",

      "description": "Laboratory-generated environments are substantial parts of the work involved in developing and validating methods for sampling volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in workplace atmospheres. We assessed the variability of samples produced by our dynamic atmosphere generation system designed for VOC generation and sampling. The characterization of bias and variability was conducted across various atmospheres containing pure n-heptane as well as mixtures of VOCs, which were collected using coconut shell charcoal tubes. The analysis of VOCs from these charcoal tubes was evaluated to reveal the variability from multiple sources: the generation of the atmosphere, the sampling process, and the analytical procedures. This research aimed to quantify the extent of variability from these sources and to estimate the sampling variability associated with our dynamic generation system. Our findings indicated that sampling variability ranged from 2% for pure n-heptane to 12% for a component within a ten-VOC mixture. Notably, sample variability increased with lower concentration levels and in mixtures compared to single-component atmospheres. This study provides a foundational reference for future experiments focused on atmosphere sampling performance at lower concentrations and in mixed VOC environments.\n\nThe introduction above was rephrased by ChatGPT-4 (with training data up to April 2023) from the original work of: Doepke et al.

HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms that result in blanching of the fingers and hands, loss of sensation, pain, and reductions in manual dexterity, all of which can affect a worker\u2019s ability to perform their job and their quality of life.  Vibration exposure significantly contributes to the development of these symptoms by increasing the stress and strain within exposed tissues, which in turn can affect functioning of blood vessels, nerves and sensory receptors in those tissues.",

      "description": "Trace measurement of aerosol chemical composition in workplace atmospheres requires the development of high-throughput aerosol collectors that are compact, hand-portable, and can be operated using personal pumps. We describe the design and characterization of a compact, high flow, Turbulent-mixing Condensation Aerosol-in-Liquid Concentrator (TCALC) that allows direct collection of aerosols as liquid suspensions, for off-line chemical, biological, or microscopy analysis. The TCALC unit, measuring approximately 12 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 18 cm, operates at an aerosol sample flowrate of up to 10 L min-1, using rapid mixing of a hot flow saturated with water vapor and a cold aerosol sample flow, thereby promoting condensational growth of aerosol particles. We investigated the effect of operating parameters such as vapor temperature, growth tube wall temperature, and aerosol sample flowrate, along with the effect of particle diameter, inlet humidity, aerosol concentration, and operation time on TCALC performance. Nanoparticles with an initial aerodynamic diameter \u2265 25 nm could grow to droplet diameters > 1400 nm with an efficiency \u2265 80%. Good droplet growth efficiency was achieved for sampled aerosol relative humidity \u2265 9%. We measured complete aerosol collection for concentrations of \u2264 3\u00d7105 cm-3. The results showed good agreement between the particulate mass collected through the liquid collector and direct filter collection. The TCALC eliminates the need for sample preparation and filter digestion during chemical analysis, thereby increasing sample recovery and substantially improving the limit of detection and sensitivity of off-line trace analysis of collected liquid samples.",

      "description": "Over-exposure of the hand-arm system to intense vibration and force over time may cause degeneration of the vascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems in the fingers. A novel animal model using rat tails has been developed to understand the health effects on human fingers exposed to vibration and force when operating powered hand tools or workpieces. The biodynamic responses, such as vibration stress, strain, and power absorption density, of the rat tails can be used to help evaluate the health effects related to vibration and force and to establish a dose-effect relationship. While the biodynamic responses of cadaver rat tails have been investigated, the objective of the current study was to determine whether the biodynamic responses of living rat tails are different from those of cadaver rat tails, and whether the biodynamic responses of both living and cadaver tails change with exposure duration. To make direct comparisons, the responses of both cadaver and living rat tails were examined on four different testing stations. The transfer function of each tail under a given contact force (2 N) was measured at each frequency in the one-third octave bands from 20 to 1000 Hz, and used to calculate the mechanical system parameters of the tails. The transfer function was also measured at different exposure durations to determine the time dependency of the response. The biodynamic responses of both cadaver and living rat tails, and the modeling results and time dependency are presented in a manuscript of this study (Warren et al., 2024), the original datasets measured in each trial of the tests are documented in this data description.",

      "description": "It is widely acknowledged that there are costs involved with fatal injury to workers. These costs cross numerous boundaries, and generally address the overall costs to victims and the affected groups, and to society as a whole. This represents a cause for concern to employers, worker groups, policy makers, medical personnel, economists and others interested in workplace safety and health. This broad-reaching burden can include social costs, organizational costs, familial and interpersonal group costs, as well as personal costs such as suffering and loss of companionship. The data in the accompanying tables focus on monetary costs of fatal occupational injury which largely consist of foregone wages, but also include the direct costs of medical care and the indirect costs of household production and certain ancillary measures.\n\nThese data represent a continuation of prior research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that attempted to delimit the economic consequences of workplace injury for earlier years. Interested parties should be aware that these data serve as a supplemental update to prior NIOSH publications which described the magnitude and circumstances of occupational injury deaths for earlier years 1,2.\n\nThe current data build on this research, and the findings are compelling. Over the period studied, 2003-2010, the costs from these 42,380 premature deaths exceeded $44 billion, an amount greater than the reportable gross domestic product for some States. These findings inform the national will to reduce this severe toll on our nation\u2019s workers, institutions, communities, and the nation itself. Researchers and concerned parties within the occupational and public health professions, academia, organizations focusing on workplace safety, labor unions and the business community have all proven to be willing and avid users of this data, and have used this research to continue their efforts, in concert with continuing NIOSH research efforts, to reduce the great toll that injury imposes on our workers, workplaces, and Nation.",

The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss among U.S. industries.\n\nMethods: We examined 2000\u20132008 audiograms for male and female workers ages 18\u201365, who had higher occupational noise exposures than the general population. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for hearing loss were estimated and compared across industries.\n\nResults: In our sample, 18% of workers had hearing loss. When compared with the Couriers and Messengers industry sub-sector, workers employed in Mining (PR = 1.65, CI = 1.57\u20131.73), Wood Product Manufacturing (PR = 1.65, CL = 1.61\u2013 1.70), Construction of Buildings (PR = 1.59, CI = 1.51\u20131.68), and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (PR = 1.61, CL = 1.51\u20131.71) had higher risks for hearing loss.\n\nConclusions: Workers in the Mining, Manufacturing, and Construction industries need better engineering controls for noise and stronger hearing conservation strategies.

      "description": "Occupational exposure to 4,4\u2019-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate (dNCO), is associated with occupational asthma (OA) development. Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may plays important roles during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior studies identified MDI/MDI-GSH-exposure downregulates endogenous human/murine(hsa/mmu)-microRNA(miR)-206-3p, resulting in the activation of mmu/hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling including KLF4-mediated signaling in M\u00d8s. The hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling activation leading to induction of chemokines and chemotaxis activities of immune cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI/ MDI in the form of MDI-GSH conjugate exposure downregulated endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p expression is unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in many different biological processes by targeting endogenous miRs, affecting protein translation and gene transcription in different cell types. The circRNA expression can be regulated via outside stimuli exposures; however, whether MDI-exposure influence circRNAs expression is unknown. Several circRNAs have been identified to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p levels through miR binding/targeting. We hypothesize that MDI-exposure induces endogenous circRNA(s) to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p in M\u00d8s. The first aim of this study was to identified candidate hsa-miR-206-3p-binding circRNA(s) that can be regulated by MDI/MDI-GSH regulated. The second aim of this study was to examine whether MDI/MDI-GSH regulated hsa-miR-206-3p-binding circRNA(s) can indeed regulate the endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p in M\u00d8s. After identified the roles of endogenous circRNA(s) in regulation of endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p after MDI/MDI-GSH-exposure, we investigated the roles of circRNAs in regulation of hsa-miR-206-3p-mediated M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines\u2019 expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the reaction products generated from gas-phase bleach oxidants and limonene, a fragrance compound commonly found in indoor air due to personal care products and cleaning products.  Gas-phase reactions were prepared in Teflon chambers housing HOCl, Cl2, and limonene.  The resulting chemical products were collected and analyzed using gas-phase preconcentration following by gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Several chlorinated products were detected including a limonene chlorohydrin and limonene species containing one, two, and three chlorines.  Product concentration and yields were estimated for the most abundant products, and greater than 80% of the transformed limonene was represented in the detected products.  Temporal sampling of the reactions allowed time courses to be plotted for limonene transformation and chlorinated limonene product generation under different conditions including the treatments of HOCl/Cl2, Cl2 only, high vs. low relative humidity, and +/- ozone. These experiments provide additional insight into the chemical transformations initiated by sodium hypochlorite bleach oxidants in the gas phase which may be of interest to human health.",

      "description": "A new high-flow, compact aerosol concentrator, using rapid, turbulent mixing to grow aerosol particles into droplets for dry spot sample collection, has been designed and tested. The \u201cTCAC (Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator)\u201d is composed of a saturator for generating hot vapor, a mixing section where the hot vapor mixes with the cold aerosol flow, a growth tube where condensational droplet growth primarily occurs, and a converging nozzle that focuses the droplets into a beam. The prototype concentrator utilizes an aerosol sample flow rate of 4 L min-1. The TCAC was optimized by varying the operating conditions, such as relative humidity of the aerosol flow, mixing flow ratio, vapor temperature, and impaction characteristics. The results showed that particles with a diameter \u2265 25 nm can be grown to a droplet diameter > 1400 nm with near 100 % efficiency. Complete activation and growth were observed at relative humidity \u2265 25 % of the aerosol sample flow. A consistent spot sample with a diameter of D90 = 1.4 mm (the diameter of a circle containing 90 % of the deposited particles) was obtained regardless of the aerosol particle diameter (dp = 20 \u2013 1900 nm). For fiber counting applications using phase contrast microscopy, the TCAC can reduce the sampling time, or counting uncertainty, by two to three orders of magnitude, compared to the 25-mm-filter collection. The study shows that the proposed mixing-flow scheme enables a compact spot sample collector suitable for handheld or portable applications, while still allowing for high flow rates.",

However, the mechanical behavior of the tail during compression needs to be better understood to improve the model and its applications. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the static and time-dependent force responses of the rat tail during compression. Compression tests were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley cadaver rat tails using a micromechanical testing system at three deformation velocities and three deformation magnitudes. Contact-width, and the time-histories of force and deformation were measured. Additionally, force-relaxation tests were conducted and a Prony series was used to model the force-relaxation behavior of the tail.",

The present study evaluated the systemic and immunotoxicity of sub-chronic 28- or 10-day dermal exposure of PFHxS (0.625-5% or 15.63-125 mg/kg/dose) in a murine model.  Elevated levels of PFHxS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route.  Liver weight (% body) significantly increased and spleen weight (% body) significantly deceased with PFHxS exposure supported by histopathological changes. Additionally, PFHxS significantly reduced the humoral immune response and altered immune subsets in the spleen, suggesting immunosuppression.  Gene expression changes were observed in the liver, skin, and spleen with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, necrosis, and inflammation.  Immune-cell phenotyping identified significant decreases in B-cells, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in the spleen along with increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and neutrophils in the skin.  These findings support dermal PFHxS-induced liver damage and immune suppression.  These data support PFHxS absorption through the skin and demonstrate immunotoxicity via this exposure route, raising concern about prompting the need for further investigation.",

Previously worn N95 FFRs can serve as a source of pathogens, which can be transferred to the wearer while doffing and donning a respirator when practicing reuse. To reduce the risk of self-contamination when donning and doffing reused FFRs, the CDC suggested storing FFRs for five days between uses to allow for the decay of viable pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.

      "description": "Top impacts are considered essential tests to evaluate the shock absorption performance of commonly used type I industrial helmets. Currently, there are two major test standards that are widely applied in helmet industry: ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 and EN397.  Since drop impacts are performed using different impactors and at drop heights, results obtained using different test standards are not directly comparable. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate and compare the helmet impact test results obtained using these two frequently used helmet test standards. A representative basic Type I construction helmet model was selected for the study. A total of 19 drop impact tests were performed at different drop heights and with two different impactors (3.6 kg and 5.0 kg). Group (a) contains 10 drop impacts performed using the 3.6 kg  impactor at drop heights from 0.31 m to 1.93 m. Group (b) contains 9 drop impacts performed using the 5.0 kg impactor at drop heights from 0.22 m to 1.32 m. Each of the impact trials was replicated four times. Relationships between the peak impact force and the drop height for these two test groups were analyzed and compared. When the helmets were tested with potential impact energy smaller than critical values, a consistent trend for the relationship of peak impact force as a function of the potential impact energy was obtained. Our results show that our previously proposed quantitative evaluation approach for industrial helmets\u2019 shock absorption performance can be used with either the ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 or EN395 standard to quantify industrial helmets\u2019 shock absorption performance. Furthermore, our results illustrated that the peak impact force would not be a reliable parameter to evaluate the helmets\u2019 safety margin.",

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers are the most widely used systems with standard thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid and polycarbonate (PC) commonly used in the manufacturing processes.  Heating of the thermoplastic generates and releases particulates and fumes.  Emission constituents frequently measured include aldehydes, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes.  Inhalation of the emitted particulates and/or the fumes, that contain bisphenol A (BPA)  may pose health problems to users of these systems as well as bystanders.\n\nThe goal of the current study was to examine the effects of inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D-printing.  PC-emissions can include bisphenol A (BPA). Bisphenols are known endocrine and metabolic disruptors (i.e., they interfere with actions of steroid and thyroid hormones) and have been shown to have significant effects on a number of physiological systems including the endocrine and cardiovascular systems.  Because steroid hormones have major effects on cardiovascular function, it is possible that inhalation of PC particulate and/or BPA impact cardiovascular function.\n\nTo begin to understand how inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D printing might affect the cardiovascular system, the current study examined the effects of inhaling PC-emissions after 1, 4, 8, 15 and 30d of exposure, on peripheral vascular responses to vaso-modulating agents, on cardiac morphology and on the expression of proteins and transcripts that are markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction.",

      "description": "Occupational exposure to 4,4\u2019-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate (dNCO), is associated with occupational asthma (OA) development. Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may play a role during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior study identified that alternatively activated (M2) macrophage-associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI/MDI-Glutathione (GSH)-mediated Kr\u00fcppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) upregulation in macrophages and induced chemotaxis abilities to na\u00efve T-cells and eosinophils; however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI upregulated KLF4 expression is unclear. Previously, we identified that two microRNAs (miRs) including hsa-miR-206-3p and hsa-miR-381-3p were significantly downregulated in MDI-GSH-exposed THP-1 macrophages. In silico analysis revealed that one hsa-miR-206-3p and two hsa-miR-381-3p predicted binding sites exist on the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of KLF4 transcripts. We hypothesize that MDI/MDI-GSH exposure induces M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines through hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p mediated KLF4 upregulation in macrophages. The first aim of this study was to examine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p regulates KLF4 expression in THP-1 macrophages through a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism. Our second aim was to determine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p participates in KLF4-regulated M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines after MDI-exposure. After identifying the role of endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of KLF4 transcription factor after MDI-exposure, we investigated the role of hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines\u2019 expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

      "description": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a broad manufacturing term that encompasses a range of processes that create objects by adding material through a computer-aided design model.  Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a form of AM, which builds objects layer-by-layer deposition of feedstock material using a 3D printer machine and computer software.  Fused filament fabrication (FFF, also known as Filament Freeform Fabrication) is one 3D printing process in which filaments are melted and extruded from a heated nozzle to deposit material.  FFF is an emerging technology and one of the most popular additive manufacturing processes, especially for consumers and small manufacturers.  Polycarbonate (PC) is a versatile material and PC filaments are widely used for fused filament fabrication 3D printing.  PC filaments are often loaded with additives to achieve different properties of the print objects.  These additives range from dyes, organometallic compounds, carbon nanomaterials, nanometal oxides to micrometer-scale particles such as copper, bronze, steel, tungsten, gold, and aluminum nitride (Vance et al., 2017).   Several engineered nanomaterials were infused into PC filaments, such as silicon dioxide nanoparticles, titanium nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2021), titanium carbide nanopowder (Vidakis et al., 2022a), aluminum nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2022b), and carbon nanotubes (Potter et al., 2021).\n\nDuring heating, PC filament undergoes thermal degradation and releases fine particles (0.1 to 2.5 um) and incidental nanoparticles (d < 100 nm) as well as numerous volatile, and semi-volatile organic compounds that are likely derived from PC polymer and additives in the polymer (Azimi et al., 2016; Byrley et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2019; Stefaniak et al., 2017; Stefaniak et al., 2019; Alijagic et al., 2022; Tedla et al., 2022).   These emissions could pose a potential hazard to human health.  Currently, the potential health hazard of PC filament printing emissions has not been determined.\n\nA NIOSH research group used a condensation nuclei counter to study PC filament emission rates, and determined that the number-based particle emission rates from an industrial-scale material extrusion AM machine were around 2.2 x1011 number/minute and the total volatile organic compound emission rates were around 1.9 x 104 \u00b5g/minute (Stefaniak et al., 2019).  The same group also found low levels of acetone, benzene, toluene, and m,p-xylene during PC filament printing processes.  Potter et al showed that PC filament emissions contained bisphenol A (BPA), phenol, chlorobenzene, DEHP, and di-tert-butylphenol (Potter et al., 2019).  In our previous studies on PC filament printer emission-induced cell toxicity (Farcas et al., 2019), emissions from a commercial PC 3D printer were generated in a chamber using a 3D printer and collected in cell culture medium.  The number-based size distribution of the particles inside the chamber was between 140-170 nm and the mean particle sizes in cell culture medium were 201\u00b118 nm.  Analysis of elemental composition of particles collected in the cell culture medium found C, O, Ca, Na, Si, Ni, Cr, Fe, S, Al, and Cl.  The organic compounds in the emission collection cell culture medium were BPA, p-isopropenylphenol, and phenol.  At 24 h post-exposure, PC emissions were internalized in human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and induced a dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, necrosis, and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in SAEC (Farcas et al., 2019).  The results demonstrated that PC filament 3D printing emissions induce a cellular toxicity in SAEC.\n\nAlthough cell-based in vitro toxicity analysis is increasingly applied to screen and rank chemicals for prioritizing toxicity studies, as well as to study toxic mechanisms, the toxicological significance of in vitro study-generated data in hazard and risk assessment is limited.  In comparison with animal-based in vivo studies,  in vitro cell studies can lack tissue-specific differentiated functions, physiological context with other cells and  tissues, and biological concordance in metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals (Blaauboer, 2008).\n\nThis study sought to evaluate PC filament printer emission-induced pulmonary and systemic toxicity in rats.  A real-time 3D printer emission generation system was applied to simultaneously use three commercially available 3D PC filament printers to generate PC filament aerosols consisting of a mixture of particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were delivered to an animal exposure chamber.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 3D PC filament emissions in a time-course via whole body inhalation.  The rats were exposed to a single concentration (0.529 mg/m3 average, 40 nm mean diameter) of the emissions for 1, 4, 8, 15, and 30 days (4 h/day, 4 days/week), and were sacrificed at 24 h after the last exposure.  Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected to analyze inflammatory, fibrotic, and oxidative stress responses.  Lung and nasal tissues underwent histopathological analysis to evaluate the emission-induced tissue damages.  Several blood biomarkers were tested for the emission-induced systemic toxicity in rats.",

The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.",

HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.  Blood flow (laser doppler) and sensitivity of the tail to pressure (Randall-Selitto pressure test) was measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of the exposure.  The sensitivity of the tail nerves to electrical stimulation was measured on days 2 and 9.",

      "description": "Thermal spray coating is a process in which molten metal is sprayed onto a surface. Little is known about the health effects associated with these aerosols. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 4 d) generated during thermal spray coating using different consumables [i.e., stainless-steel wire (PMET731), Ni-based wire (PMET885), Zn-based wire (PMET540)]. Control animals received air. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at 4 and 30 d post-exposure to assess lung toxicity. The particles were chain-like agglomerates and similar in size (310\u2013378 nm). Inhalation of PMET885 aerosol caused a significant increase in lung injury and inflammation at both time points. Inhalation of PMET540 aerosol caused a slight but significant increase in lung toxicity at 4 but not 30 d. Exposure to PMET731 aerosol had no effect on lung toxicity. Overall, the lung responses were in the order: PMET885>>PMET540>PMT731. Following a shorter exposure (25 mg/m3 x 4 h/d x 1d), lung burdens of metals from the different aerosols were determined by ICP-AES at 0, 1, 4 and 30 d post-exposure. Zn was cleared from the lungs at the fastest rate with complete clearance by 4 d post-exposure. Ni, Cr, and Mn had similar rates of clearance as nearly half of the deposited metal was cleared by 4 d. A small but significant percentage of each of these metals persisted in the lungs at 30 d. The pulmonary clearance of Fe was difficult to assess because of inherently high levels of Fe in control lungs.",

      "description": "Aspergillus versicolor is ubiquitous in the environment and is particularly abundant in damp indoor spaces. Exposure to Aspergillus species, as well as other environmental fungi, has been linked to adverse health outcomes including asthma, allergy, and even local or disseminated infection. However, the pulmonary immunological mechanisms associated with repeated exposure to A. versicolor have remained relatively uncharacterized. Here, A. versicolor was cultured and desiccated on rice, then placed in an acoustical generator system to achieve aerosolization. Mice were challenged with titrated doses of aerosolized conidia to examine deposition, lymphoproliferative properties, and then the immunotoxicological response to repeated inhalation exposures. The necessary dose to induce lymphoproliferation, but not infection-like pathology, was identified. Further, it was determined that the dose was able to initiate localized immune responses. The data presented in this study demonstrate an optimized and reproducible method for delivering A. versicolor conidia to rodents via nose-only inhalation. Additionally, the feasibility of a long-term repeated exposure study was established.  This experimental protocol can be used in future studies to investigate physiological effects of repeated pulmonary exposure to fungal conidia utilizing a practical and relevant mode of delivery. In total, these data constitute an important foundation for subsequent research in the field.",

      "description": "Exposure to 4,4\u2019-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, in the occupational setting may lead to the development of occupational asthma (OA). Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI induces OA remain an active area of research. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. Upon exposure to outside stimuli, macrophages are polarized into either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization is associated with asthma development where M2 macrophage populations are usually pronounced in lungs of asthmatic patients. Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that M2 macrophage associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI exposure, indicating that MDI may induce M2 macrophage polarization; however, the underling molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI causes induction of M2 associated markers and chemokines is unclear. M2 macrophage polarization can be regulated by activation of several M2 associated transcription factors; however, whether MDI exposure regulates these transcription factors is unknown. We hypothesize that MDI exposure induces M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines through upregulation of M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in macrophages. The first aim of this study is to verify whether MDI-exposure can induce M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokine expression that were observed in previous studies and to identify candidate M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in response to MDI exposure that may account for the M2 macrophage polarization. After identification of the candidate transcription factor(s) that can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigate the roles of the candidate transcription factor in regulation of these candidate M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

      "description": "Nanotechnology is one of the most rapidly developing areas of the economy and involves the study and control of matter in the nanoscale. The nanoscale is the size range from 1 to 100 nm. Recently, some nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to enter the brain through the olfactory pathway from the nose to the brain. \u2060This pathway can potentially enable inhaled nanomaterials to enter the brain. Inhalation exposures are technically difficult and expensive. Intranasal instillation is a potential screening tool for evaluating nose to brain transport. However, particles in aqueous media tend to agglomerate and agglomerated particles often act like larger particles in terms of surface area, toxicity, and size thresholds for transport pathways. For neuronal transport within the brain, the upper size limit is estimated to be approximately 100 nm. Therefore, nanomaterials must be adequately dispersed in the vehicle used for instillation in order to evaluate their potential for transport from the nose to the brain.\n\nBecause 100 nm is the upper size limit estimated for transport within the central nervous system, components of dispersion media may need to be different from dispersion media used to evaluate toxicity in other tissues. For example, albumin, a protein which is useful in dispersion media developed for the lung, can interact with nanomaterials and increase their size. In addition, neurons transport sodium out of the cell, suggesting that a dispersion medium to evaluate nose-to-brain transport should avoid high sodium concentrations. To overcome issues with the size of albumin and other proteins as well as the potential effects of sodium and phosphate, we hypothesized that free amino acids, a balanced electrolyte solution, and a mixture of phospholipids could produce a solution that both dispersed nanomaterials and was compatible with neuronal transport. This study describes and characterizes a solution for nasal and olfactory transport (SNOT) that can disperse nanomaterials and dyes with nanoscale dimensions, enabling intranasal instillation so that potential nose-to-brain transport can be evaluated.",

      "description": "Concentrated collection of aerosol particles on a substrate is essential for their chemical analysis using various microscopy and laser spectroscopic techniques. An impaction-based aerosol concentration system was developed for focused collection of particles using a multi-stage nozzle that consists of a succession of multiple smooth converging stages. Converging sections of the nozzle were designed to focus and concentrate a particle diameter range of 900 to 2500 nm into a relatively narrower particle beam to obtain particulate deposits with spot diameters of 0.5-1.56 mm. A slightly diverging section before the last contractions was included to allow for better focusing of particles at the lower end of the collectable diameter range. The characterization of this multi-stage nozzle and the impaction-based aerosol concentration system encompassing the nozzle was accomplished both numerically and experimentally. The numerical and experimental trends in collection efficiency and spot diameters agreed well qualitatively; however, the quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results for wall losses was poor, particularly for larger particle diameters. The resulting concentrated particulate deposit, a spot sample, was analysed using Raman spectroscopy to probe effect of spot size on analytical sensitivity of measurement. The method\u2019s sensitivity was compared against other conventional techniques, such as filtration and aerosol focused impaction, implementing condensational growth.  Impaction encompassing the multi-stage focusing nozzle is the only method that can ensure high sensitivity at Reynolds numbers greater than 2000, that can be supported by small pumps which renders such method suitable for portable instrumentation.",

      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are used extensively by healthcare personnel (HCP) during a pandemic. FFRs are primarily reserved for those personnel who have a greater risk and longer duration of exposure compared with other workers and the general public. Some FFR models contain an exhalation valve, which is a device that closes to allow inhaled breath to be pulled through the filter media and opens to allow exhaled breath to be expelled from the respirator through the exhalation valve as well as the filter media. These FFR models provide the wearer with a level of protection like that of an FFR without an exhalation valve, and they are thought to increase the wearer\u2019s comfort at high work rates and be suitable for longer periods of use. However, respiratory secretions expelled by wearers may exit along with air through the exhalation valve. A concern with FFRs with an exhalation valve is that individuals may spread disease if unfiltered, virus-laden aerosols pass through the valve.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend using an FFR with an exhalation valve for source control (i.e., to filter respiratory secretions to prevent disease transmission to others) and advised that if only this option isavailable and source control was needed, then the valve should be covered with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. The CDC requested research to provide improved science-based recommendations on the use of exhalation valves.\n\nThis study had three aims: (1) to measure the filtration efficiency provided by FFRs with an exhalation valve under conditions of inward airflow (i.e., in the direction of inhalation) and outward airflow (i.e., in the direction of exhalation); (2) to evaluate how particle penetration in FFRs with an exhalation valve compares to particle penetration in surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts; and (3) to determine the filtration efficiency of three modifications to the exhalation valve in FFRs with the goal of mitigating the emission of unfiltered particles. To accomplish these three aims, thirteen FFR models were each tested in two positions: inward position, which is used by the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program when testing N-type respirators, and outward position, which was used experimentally to channel airflow in the direction of exhalation. For the inward position, three mitigation strategies were used:\n(1)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with commonly available surgical tape,\n(2)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with an electrocardiogram (ECG) pad; and\n(3)stretching a surgical mask over the exterior of the FFR.\n\nThe purpose of these three strategies was to measure the varying filtration efficiencies to determine their contribution toward source control. Both positions and all mitigation strategies were tested at three airflow rates: 25, 55, and 85 lpm (liters per minute). In addition to the FFR evaluations, researchers evaluated a selection of surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts using the outward position and flowrates described previously.",

The method described here collects DPM particles onto a quartz fiber filter, after which reflection-mode infrared spectra are measured on a mid-infrared Fourier transform (FT-IR) spectrometer. Several infrared absorption bands are investigated for their efficacy in quantifying OC and EC. The thermo-optical (T-O) method is used to calibrate a linear regression model to predict OC and EC from the infrared spectra. The calibrated model, generated from laboratory DPM samples, is then utilized to quantify OC and EC in\nmine samples obtained from two metal mine locations under a variety of operating conditions. The feasibility of further improving these results by partial least squares (PLS) regression was investigated. A single calibration that is broadly applicable would be considered an improvement over currently available portable instruments, which require aerosol-specific calibration.",

Male rats were exposed to 3D-printer emissions (500 \u00b5g/cm3) or filtered air for 1, 4, 8, 15 or 30d for 4d/week (4h/day).  The effects of these exposures on hormone concentrations, and markers of function, injury and/or oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and testes were measured after 1, 8 and 30d of exposure.  Thirty days of exposure to 3D-emissions resulted in reductions in  thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin.  These changes were accompanied by increases in markers of cell injury and reductions in active mitochondria in the olfactory bulb, gonadotropin releasing hormone cells and fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeled fibers in the arcuate nucleus, and reductions in spermatogonium.  PC plastics contain high concentrations bisphenol A and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the health effects of inhaling 3D-printer emissions may be due to bisphenol A.",

      "description": "Fibrogenic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) induce the polarization of M1 and M2 macrophages in mouse lungs. Polarization of the macrophages regulates the production of proinflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs) to mediate acute inflammation and its resolution in a time-dependent manner. Here we examined the molecular mechanism by which multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs, Mitsui-7) induce M1 polarization in vitro. Treatment of murine macrophages (J774A.1) with Mitsui-7 MWCNTs increased the expression of Alox5 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The MWCNTs induced the expression of CD68, and that induction persisted for up to 3 days post-exposure. The expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase, an intracellular marker of M1, were increased by MWCNTs. Consistent with M1 polarization, the MWCNTs induced the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, and proinflammatory LMs leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The cell-free media from MWCNT-polarized macrophages induced the migration of neutrophilic cells (differentiated from HL-60), which was blocked by Acebilustat, a specific leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, or LY239111, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, but not NS-398, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, revealing LTB4 as a major mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis from MWCNT-polarized macrophages. Knockdown of Alox5 using specific small hairpin-RNA suppressed MWCNT-induced M1 polarization, LTB4 secretion, and migration of neutrophils. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the polarization of M1 macrophages by Mitsui-7 MWCNTs in vitro and that induction of Alox5 is an important mechanism by which the MWCNTs promote proinflammatory responses by boosting M1 polarization and production of proinflammatory LMs.",

      "description": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is as a major cause of death and disability experienced by nearly 3 million people annually resulting from falls, vehicular accidents, or from being struck by or against an object. While TBIs can range in severity, the majority of injuries are considered to be mild. However, TBI of any severity has the potential to have long-lasting neurological effects including headaches, cognitive/memory impairments, mood dysfunction, and fatigue as a result of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. The goal of the study was to evaluate the neuroinflammatory and neuronal damage outcomes associated with mild or moderate-severe TBI via the modification of an established closed-head injury model of TBI by varying the material of the projectile.  Rats that received TBI using a stainless steel projectile exhibited outcomes strongly correlated to moderate-severe TBI, such as prolonged unconsciousness, impaired neurobehavior, increased risk for hematoma and death, as well as significant neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation throughout the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum.  In contrast, rats that received TBI with an aluminum projectile exhibited characteristics more congruous with mild TBI, such as a trend for longer periods of unconscious in the absence of neurobehavioral deficits, a lack of neurodegeneration and mild neuroinflammation.  Our results indicate that different levels of behavioral, neuroinflammatory, and damage outcomes are associated with differing levels of TBI severity.",

      "description": "The fundamental goal of this study was to develop an in vivo model of the exposome that could be used to evaluate exposure-induced alterations in local and systemic immune markers as a function of various exposomal factors. Accordingly, the model was designed to mimic an occupationally-relevant scenario in which inhalation of welding fumes (WF) constituted the primary occupational/environmental exposure of interest. Immune endpoints were assessed at three different time points representative of different stages in the exposure/response timeline (before WF exposure, directly after, and following a 12 wk recovery period). Moreover, the potential impact of genetic variation and lifestyle factors on the immune response to WF exposure and subsequent recovery was addressed by incorporating two different rat strains (Sprague-Dawley [SD] and Brown Norway [BN]) and two variations in diet (regular and high fat) into the model.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of this study was to determine whether consumption of a HF diet is associated with increased immunological responsivity following exposure to a common respiratory toxicant. The study was also executed with the goal of identifying which experimental factor (genetics/strain, diet, occupational exposure) is most influential in the modulation of local and systemic markers of immune status following WF exposure, and subsequently, the efficacy of inflammation resolution. The information obtained from these analyses will help elucidate which exposomic determinants may be particularly relevant in the context of immunotoxicity, and accordingly, warrant special attention in future investigations. The results will also contribute to the development of other in vivo exposome models and direct future efforts related to the exposome and its impact on human health.",

This study aimed to compare the immunological impact of repeated pulmonary exposure to pathogenic and non-pathogenic Cryptococcus yeasts. Mice were repeatedly exposed to either C. neoformans, V. victoriae, or PBS control, and the immune responses were analyzed by measuring histopathological scores, and quantifications of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung via flow cytometry, and cytokine concentrations in the lung.

      "description": "Workers across every occupational sector have the potential to be exposed to a wide variety of chemicals, and the skin is a primary route of exposure. Furthermore, exposure to certain chemicals has been linked to inflammatory and allergic diseases. Thus, understanding the immune responses to chemical exposures on the skin and the potential for inflammation and sensitization is needed to improve worker safety and health. Responses in the skin microenvironment impact the potential for sensitization and these responses may include the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammasome activation, barrier integrity, skin microbiota, and the presence of immune cells. Selection of mouse strain to evaluate skin effects, such as haired (BALB/c) or hairless (SKH1) mice, varies dependent on the experimental design and needs of a study. However, dermal chemical exposure may impact reactions in the skin differently depending on the strain of mouse. Additionally, there is a need for established methods to evaluate immune responses in the skin. In this study, exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan was evaluated in two mouse models using immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis.  The flow cytometry panel reported in this manuscript in combination with gene expression analysis may be used in future studies to better evaluate the effect of chemical exposures on the skin immune response.  These findings may be important to consider during strain selection, experimental design, and result interpretation of chemical exposures on the skin.",

      "description": "We describe design and characterization of an aerosol NanoSpotTM collector, designed for collection of airborne particles on a microscopy substrate for direct electron microscopy, optical microscopy, and laser spectroscopy analysis. The collector implements a water-based, laminar-flow, condensation growth technique, followed by impaction onto an optical/electron microscopy substrate or a transmission electron microscopy grid for direct analysis. The compact design employs three parallel growth tubes allowing a sampling flow rate of 1.2 L min-1. Each of the three growth tubes consists of three-temperature regions, for controlling the water vapor saturation profile and exit dew point. Following the droplet growth, the three streams merge into one flow and a converging nozzle enhances focusing of the grown droplets into a tight beam, prior to their final impaction on the warm surface of the collection substrate. A miniscule sample deposition area is attained for effective coupling with microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. Experiments were conducted for the acquisition of the size-dependent collection efficiency, the uniformity of the spot deposit, the surface density distribution of the collected particles, and the aerosol concentration effect on the triple-tube NanoSpotTM Collector. Particles as small as 7 nm could be activated and collected on the electron microscopy stub. A spot deposit of approximately 0.7-mm diameter is formed for particles over a broad particle diameter range. The collected particle samples were analyzed using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy for the acquisition of the particle spatial distribution, the spot sample uniformity, and the analyte concentration. Finally, the NanoSpotTM collector\u2019s analytical measurement sensitivity for laser Raman analysis and the counting statistics for fiber count measurement using optical microscopy were calculated and were compared with those of the conventional aerosol sampling methods.",

      "description": "Nanomaterials represent a new class of materials with numerous industrial applications. Considering the projected increase in the production and use of nanomaterials, a corresponding increase in occupational exposure to nanomaterials and their resulting adverse health effects should be anticipated among workers. There is substantial evidence in the literature, based on cell culture and animal studies, supporting the potential toxicity and detrimental health effects associated with exposure to nanomaterials. Intervention and/or prevention of adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials will be a major concern for health providers and regulatory and non-regulatory government agencies as the use of nanomaterials expand. A key element in the intervention and/or prevention of the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary toxicity induced by nanomaterials.\n\nDue to its physicochemical and mechanical properties, nanocellulose has found many applications in manufactured goods in the paper and food industry, cosmetics, biomedicine, and pharmaceuticals. There is potential for human exposure to nanocellulose or products that contain nanocellulose both during the production and use of the materials that contain nanocellulose. The objectives of the current study were to determine lung toxicity potential of crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) and the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity. A rat inhalation exposure model was employed to determine the lung toxicity potential of CNC. Global gene expression profile in the lung and bioinformatic analysis of the gene expression data were conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the CNC-induced lung toxicity.",

The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays an important role as a physical barrier and regulator of the immune system. Alterations in the barrier and immune regulatory functions of the skin have been demonstrated to increase the risk of sensitization and development of allergic disease. In this study, the impact of triclosan exposure on the skin barrier and keratinocyte function was investigated using a model of reconstructed human epidermis.

      "description": "Understanding the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection is vital for developing intervention strategies. The primary barriers for invading respiratory pathogens are the airway epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and antimicrobial peptides produced by these cells. The antimicrobial peptide, \u03b2-defensin-1, has antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Significant downregulation of \u03b2-defensin1 gene (DEFB1) expression was observed when human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were exposed to IAV. HBEpCs overexpressing DEFB1 caused a significant reduction in IAV, that was confirmed by IAV matrix gene analysis and confocal microscopy. DEFB1expression after transfection with hsa-miR-186-5p and hsa-miR-340-5p provided evidence that DEFB1 expression could be modulated by these two miRNAs and hsa-miR-186-5p had a higher binding efficiency with DEFB1. Overexpression of DEFB1 in IAV infected HBEpCs led to increased NF-kB expression.  In a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array analysis of 84 transcription factors, either overexpressing DEFB1 or siRNA silencing of DEFB1 expression significantly modulated the expression of STAT3.  In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) integrated with PCR array data showed that the JAK1/STAT3 pathway was significantly altered by cells overexpressing DEFB1, suggesting that this may be one of the pathways by which defensin regulates IAV replication in HBEpCs. In conclusion, the reduction in IAV copy number in DEFB1 overexpressing cells suggests that \u03b2-defensin-1 plays a key role in regulating IAV survival through STAT3 and is a potential target for antiviral drug development.",

      "description": "SARS-CoV-2 spreads by infectious aerosols and droplets expelled from the respiratory tract. Masks and respirators can reduce the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking these aerosols and droplets at the source. The ability of source control devices to block aerosols can be tested by expelling an aerosol through a headform wearing the device. These tests may be performed using constant airflows, which are simpler, or cyclic airflows, which are more realistic but require more complex methods. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the results found using constant vs. cyclic airflows.\n\nA source control measurement system was used to measure the efficacy of two cloth face masks, two medical masks with and without an elastic mask brace, a neck gaiter, and an N95 respirator as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols. With this system, the aerosol flows from the inside of the mask toward the outside; that is, the aerosol flows in the same direction as it would flow during an exhalation by a person wearing the source control device. The experiments were conducted under four airflow conditions: cyclic breathing at 15 liters/minute (L/min), cyclic breathing at 85 L/min, constant outward airflow at 15 L/min, and constant outward airflow at 85 L/min. Each experiment began by placing the source control device on the headform and performing a fit test. The measurement system collection chamber was then sealed, and the cyclic or constant airflow and the aerosol generation were initiated. The aerosol concentration in the collection chamber was measured using an optical particle spectrometer (OPS). The source control collection efficiency was determined by comparing the steady-state concentration of aerosol particles in the collection chamber when the source control device was worn with the concentration when no source control device was used.",

      "description": "In the oil and gas industry, workers are potentially exposed to crude oil or crude oil vapor (COV) during upstream (drilling and extraction), midstream (transportation and storage), as well as downstream (refining) activities.  Worker exposure to various fractions of crude oil have been linked to mortality, as well as musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory problems, and cancer.  During the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, response workers were exposed to a variety of chemical hazards including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, as well as components of the oil dispersants employed to disperse the oil.  The Gulf Long-term Follow-up (GuLF) STUDY had reported that workers involved in the cleanup operations experienced adverse hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac problems.  However, long-term neurological effects remain unknown.\n\nHealth Hazard Evaluation (HHE) surveys conducted by NIOSH among the cleanup workers identified a variety of health effects, including neurological symptoms.  Unfortunately, as a significant number of response workers who experienced health symptoms were exposed to both crude oil and the oil dispersant that was aerially sprayed to the contain the spill, the health effects of crude oil exposures alone were difficult to discern from these surveys.  It is here that laboratory-based studies are advantageous as they can provide ample health risk information to establish the toxicological potential of the various chemical hazards at the workplace.  To that end, the present work evaluated the neurotoxic risks of COV generated from the Macondo well crude oil that was used as a surrogate for the DWH crude oil.",

      "description": "The occupational exposure risk to peracetic acid (PAA), a common disinfectant and sterilant use in industrial settings like healthcare facilities and meat processing plants, is typically assessed through collection and analysis of atmospheric workplace samples. In this study, a new personal sampling technique was developed for determining the atmospheric concentration of PAA in the workplace. Samples of humidified air containing peracetic acid (concentration range: 25-2000 ppb) were collected on 350-mg XAD-7 solid sorbent tubes to adsorb the analyte. Peracetic acid was desorbed using anhydrous acetonitrile, after which it was treated with excess cyclohexene to generate the corresponding epoxide via the Prilezhaev reaction. The epoxide product was analyzed and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indirectly determining the amount of peracetic acid in the original air sample. The specificity for peracetic acid over other contaminants was assessed through a series of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetic acid (AA) spiking experiments, in which selectivity for PAA was demonstrated at several different concentrations of both HP and AA. The limit-of-detection (LOD) and the limit-of-quantitation (LOQ) for this method was determined to be 60 ppb and 198 ppb, respectively. Unlike many other methods, the sorbent tube negates the need for solvent in the sampling apparatus, adding to its ease of use. These features as well as inexpensive materials and the use of small, wearable vacuum pumps could allow for implementation of easier personal sampling in the workplace.",

      "description": "Measurement of vapors from solutions containing propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) released inside a closed chamber were evaluated. Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 \u00b5L and a LOQ of 3.5 \u00b5L was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry\u2019s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ.  Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.",

      "description": "Loading-induced hypertrophy with transcriptional upregulation has been observed concomitant with nuclei accretion in various studies regarding both humans and rodents.   Bruusgaard et al. in 2010 pioneered work utilizing a model of synergist ablation to cause hypertrophy followed by denervation-induced atrophy to demonstrate that load-induced gains in myonuclei could be long-lasting after the termination of such exposure.  This finding was consistent with the idea of enduring myonuclear accretion as a form of \u201cmuscle memory\u201d allowing enhanced muscle adaptation following a period of detraining.  Subsequent research groups further investigated this possibility in the context of exercise utilizing rodents and various loaded exercise paradigms such as weighted wheel running and ladder climbing.  This research yielded a spectrum of results.  While these studies were instrumental in highlighting the variation in outcomes possible following load-induced hypertrophy in general, they were limited in their direct relatedness to resistance training \u2013 the predominate form of exposure utilized to induce hypertrophy.  Our research group has established and repeatedly validated a rat research model to investigate resistance-type training.   The model is based on using a dynamometer to precisely expose dorsiflexor muscles of rats to 8 sets of 10 repetitions (per set) of stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs) \u2013 a consecutive sequence of isometric, lengthening, and shortening contractions.  Training with this exposure 3 sessions per week for one month results in increases in muscle mass and performance.  This is accompanied by an increase in muscle fiber area accompanied by a proportional increase in myonuclei number and a rise in overall transcriptional output as measured by total RNA levels.  The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent alterations in performance, muscle mass, nuclei number, and transcriptional output persist several months following the termination of this relevant and valid model of resistance-type training.",

Nasal insufflation of IL-11 causes AHR in wild-type mice while lung inflammation induced by antigen sensitization and challenge, which mimics features of atopic asthma in humans, is attenuated in mice genetically deficient in IL-11 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-11R\u03b11-deficient mice), a transmembrane receptor that is required along with glycoprotein 130 to transduce IL-11 intracellular signaling.  Nevertheless, the contribution of IL-11R\u03b11 to the manifestation of phenotypic features of non-atopic asthma are not presently known.

Exposure to WBV has been associated with an increased risk for neck and back pain.  However, the findings of other studies have suggested that occupational exposure to WBV may also serve as a risk factor for the development of a number of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.

      "description": "Thermal spray coating is an industrial process where molten metal is sprayed onto a surface as a protective coat at high velocity. Using acellular, in vitro, and in vivo models, the toxicity of these aerosols was evaluated. An automated electric arc wire thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system were developed to simulate an occupational exposure in an experimental model. Using the inhalation system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to stainless steel PMET720 aerosols at 25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d. Lung injury, inflammation, and cytokine alteration were determined. Resolution of the response was assessed by evaluating these parameters at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. The aerosols generated were also collected and characterized. Macrophages were exposed to 0 \u2013 200 \u00b5g/ml of the collected particles to determine cytotoxicity and screened for known mechanisms of toxicity. Other metal particles similar in composition and morphology, gas metal arc (GMA-SS) and manual metal arc (MMA-SS) stainless steel, were used as particle controls. The influence of pressure used during the process on the toxicity profile of the generated aerosols also was assessed and found to be minimal. The PMET720 thermal spray coating particles exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity and membrane damage only at the highest dose tested. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed the PMET720 particles to have oxidative stress potential and caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular oxidative stress. There also was a dose-dependent increase in NF-kB/AP-1 activity. Treatment with uptake inhibitors showed that the PMET720 particles were internalized via clathrin- and caveolar-mediated endocytosis as wells as actin-dependent pinocytosis/phagocytosis. In most of the cell assays, the two welding fume control particles generated a greater response compared to the PMET720 particles. In vivo, lung damage, inflammation and alteration in cytokines were observed 1 day after inhalation exposure, and this response returned to air control exposure levels by day 7. Alveolar macrophages retained the particulate even after 28 days after exposure. The results suggest that compared to stainless steel welding fumes, the PMET 720 aerosols were less potent, and the animals recovered from the acute pulmonary toxicity induced after 7 days.",

This undertaking requires accurate information of workers\u2019 3D body positions to analyze kinematics and kinetics of the human body. In this study, we proposed a novel 2- stage motion estimation approach based on a convolution neural network to estimate residential roofer\u2019s body positions using three-view video data. Instead of pursuing end-to- end training, our approach includes two stages: (1) use a multi-view model to estimate the 3D pose in a single frame; (2) use a multi-frame model to apply temporal convolutions to refine the multi-view outputs. The performance of the approach was evaluated by comparing our estimation with the gold-standard marker-based 3D human pose estimation (\u201cground truth\u201d). The evaluation results show that our marker-free video-based approach can accurately capture the 3D posture of workers during the common roofing task and the proposed multi-frame model can effectively improve the precision of the coordinate sequence. The values of mean per joint position error of estimated human position before and after processing by the multi-frame model are 27.93 and 24.81 mm, respectively. These results prove that the proposed marker-free motion capture estimation approach can efficiently and accurately locate 3D body joints and pave the way for future onsite musculoskeletal motion analysis during roofing activities.",

Welding consumables devoid of Cr are being produced in attempt to limit worker exposures to potentially toxic and carcinogenic metals. The study objective was to characterize a copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) fume generated using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and determine the pulmonary deposition and toxicity of the fume in mice exposed by inhalation. Male A/J mice (6 \u2013 8 weeks of age) were exposed to air or Cu-Ni welding fumes for 2 (low deposition) or 4 (high deposition) hours/day for 10 days. Mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), macrophage function, and histopathological analysis were performed at various timepoints post-exposure to evaluate resolution. Characterization of the fume indicated that most of the particles were between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5m in diameter, with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.43 \u00b5m. Metal content of the fume was primarily Cu (~76%) and Ni (~12%). After exposure, BAL macrophages had a reduced ability to phagocytose E. coli at 1 and 7 days and lung cytotoxicity was evident and significant (>12-19% fold change). Loss of body weight was also significant at these two early timepoints. Lung inflammation, the predominant lesion identified by histopathology, was observed as a subacute response early that progressively resolved by 28 days with only macrophage aggregates remaining late (84 days). Future studies are planned to investigate the tumorigenic potential of Cu-Ni fume in A/J mice.",

Intervention and/or prevention of adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a concern for health providers and regulatory and non-regulatory government agencies as the use of nanomaterials expand. A key element in the intervention and/or prevention of the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary toxicity induced by nanomaterials.\n\nDue to its physicochemical and mechanical properties, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have found many industrial applications.

The performance of Type I industrial helmets for fall protection is not required to be tested in standardized tests. Chin straps and suspension system adjustment mechanisms are two important components of a typical industrial helmet, but the effects of proper use of them on the protective performance of Type I helmets have not been evaluated. The current study was designed to analyze the fall protection performance of Type I industrial helmets and to evaluate if the use of a chin strap and the suspension system tightness have any effect on protection performance. Head impact tests were performed by letting an instrumented manikin free fall backwards, from a standing posture, so that the manikin would make head-first contact with a solid surface of two different materials (concrete and plywood-covered). The results showed that all four tested helmet models demonstrated excellent performances for fall protection compared to the control group without wearing helmets. The fall protection performance of the advanced helmet models was substantially better than the basic helmet models. However, the effects of the use of chin straps and suspension system tightness on the helmets\u2019 fall protection performance were statistically not significant. The findings of our study provide information to help construction companies and manufacturers better manage the use of Type I helmets for fall protection, thereby reducing work-related traumatic brain injury risks.",

However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of these Cu species is limiting the future investigation of the toxicity of these materials and their potential health impact on workers. In this work, we used a combination of scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to analyze the particles released during the sanding/sawing of copper-treated lumber. We have demonstrated using EELS Cu L2,3 edges with comparative reference spectra to determine the Cu species. Three types of species, including basic copper carbonate (BCC), Cu(0), and Cu(II)-Wood complex, were identified in released wood dust particles. The unbound copper particles also exist as a form of BCC or reduced Cu(0). The morphologies and chemical states of emitted copper particles indicate the potential chemical transformation due to copper-wood interactions.",

      "description": "Thermal spray coating involves spraying a product that is melted by extremely high temperatures and then applied under pressure under pressure onto a surface. Large amounts of a complex metal aerosol (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn) are formed during the process, presenting a potentially serious risk to the operator. Information about the health effects associated with exposure to these aerosols is lacking. Even less is known about the chemical and physical properties of these aerosols. The goal was to develop and test an automated thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system that would simulate workplace exposures. An electric arc wire- thermal spray coating aerosol generator and exposure system was designed and separated into two areas: (A) an enclosed room where the spray coating occurs; (B) an exposure chamber with different measurement devices and controllers. The physicochemical properties of aerosols generated during electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using five different consumable wires were examined. The generated particles regardless of composition were poorly soluble, complex metal oxides and mostly arranged as chain-like agglomerates and similar in size distribution as determined by MOUDI and ELPI. To allow for continuous, sequential spray coating during a 4-hr exposure period, a motor rotated the metal pipe to be coated in a circular and up-and-down direction. In a pilot animal study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d) generated from electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using a stainless-steel PMET720 consumable wire. The targeted exposure chamber concentration was achieved and maintained during a 4-hr period. At 1 d after exposure, lung injury and inflammation were significantly elevated in the group exposed to the thermal spray coating aerosol compared to the air control group. A thermal spray coating inhalation system was designed and constructed that will generate continuous metal spray coating aerosols at a targeted concentration for extended periods of time without interruption for future animal exposure studies.",

The skin barrier and microbiome are thought to play important roles in mediating inflammation and allergy and disruptions may contribute to development of allergic disease. To investigate potential connections of the skin barrier and microbiome with immune responses to triclosan, SKH1 mice were dermally exposed to triclosan (0.5-2%) or vehicle for up to 7 consecutive days.",

      "description": "SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by droplets and aerosols expelled by infected people when they cough, talk, sing, or exhale. To reduce exposure to these droplets and aerosols while indoors, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal mask wearing, and room ventilation. Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable air cleaners to remove infectious material from the air more quickly and provide greater protection. We conducted a case study using respiratory simulators to examine the efficacy of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles from an infected meeting participant in a conference room. We found that, in a room with good air mixing, the use of two HEPA air cleaners meeting the EPA recommended Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) reduced the overall exposure by up to 65%, and that the combination of the HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%. The air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. Our results demonstrate that portable HEPA cleaners can be an effective method to reduce exposure to airborne particles while meeting indoors, especially in combination with universal masking.",

Because symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 can exhibit a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory fluids, the CDC recommends that people wear a face mask that covers the nose and mouth to reduce community transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wearing a face mask to protect others from potentially infectious droplets, called source control, has been shown to be a highly effective infection control strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The presence of mask face seal leaks enables respiratory aerosols to escape out rather than pass through the filtering materials of the mask, consequently reducing the benefits of wearing a face mask for source control.  As such, the current investigation examines various modifications that improve the fit of a medical or cloth face mask and reduce the amounts of expelled aerosols during simulated coughs and exhalations.",

      "description": "Occupational exposure to 4,4\u2019-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, is one of the leading causes of occupational asthma (OA). Pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which how MDI causes OA is still warranted to be elucidated. Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant immune cell type in the lung, and these cells serve as one of the first immune responders against inhaled pathogens, particles, stimuli, and chemical allergens such as dNCOs. Upon encountering outside stimuli, alveolar macrophages react by phagocytosis as well as producing and secreting different mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and others, into the alveoli microenvironment to orchestrate the initiation of inflammatory/immune responses. Dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, including elevated production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators, has been shown to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. In the clinical setting, the levels of many immune mediators produced by macrophages have been found elevated in the asthmatic airway. However, both the levels of these asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted inflammatory/immune mediators in MDI-OA patients\u2019 airways and how expression of these mediators change in response to MDI exposure in alveolar macrophages are largely undetermined. Previously, we demonstrated a microRNA (miR)-206-3p and miR-381-3p mediated PPP3CA/Calcineurin signaling induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription in macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALCs) after acute MDI exposure; however, whether this mechanism participates in regulation of other asthma-associated mediators secreted by macrophages/BALCs after MDI exposure is currently unknown. The first aim of this study was to identify candidate asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted mediators that can be regulated after MDI exposure. After identified the candidate mediators can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigated the roles of miR-mediated calcineurin signaling in regulation of these candidate mediators\u2019 expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and both na\u00efve and activated macrophages (THP-1) were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 \u00b5M of flavoring chemicals and analyzed for changes in viability, cell membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammatory cytokine release. Viability was most greatly affected by decanal, hexanal, nonanal, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, vanillin, alpha-pinene, eugenol, and limonene. High amounts of ROS were elicited by vanillin, ethyl maltol, and the diketones (2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-heptanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione) from both cell lines. Na\u00efve THP-1 cells produced significant levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 when exposed to ethyl maltol and hexanal. Activated THP-1 cells released increased IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 when exposed to ethyl maltol, but many flavoring chemicals had an apparent suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokines released by activated macrophages, with varying degrees of accompanying cytotoxicity. The diketones, L-carvone, and linalool, suppressed cytokine release in the absence of cytotoxicity.

SARS-CoV-2 can spread by exposure to droplets and very fine aerosol particles from respiratory fluids that are released by infected persons. Layered mitigation strategies, including but not limited to maintaining physical distancing, adequate ventilation, universal masking, avoiding overcrowding, and vaccination, have shown to be effective in re-ducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the indoor environment. Here, we examine the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosol particles within a classroom-style meeting room. To quantify exposure of uninfected individuals (Recip-ients), surrogate respiratory aerosol particles were generated by a breathing simulator with a headform (Source) that mimicked breath exhalations. Recipients, represented by three breathing simulators with manikin headforms, were placed in a meeting room and affixed with optical particle counters to measure 0.3\u20133 \u00b5m aerosol particles.",

The goal of the study was to evaluate the potential for the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor inhibitor and anti-inflammatory drug, propranolol, to treat neuroinflammation in a novel long-term mouse model of GWI. We established that our long-term GWI model produces enhanced and prolonged neuroinflammation that is dependent upon Gulf War-relevant organophosphate exposure. Propranolol treatment abrogated the neuroinflammation instigated in our model specifically, having no treatment effects in non-DFP exposed groups. Our results indicate that propranolol may be a promising therapy for GWI by treating the underlying neuroinflammation associated with Gulf War-relevant physiological stress and organophosphate exposures.",

      "name": "Source Apportionment and Quantification of Liquid and Headspace Leaks from Closed System Transfer Devices via Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS)",
      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "Closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) are devices which replace traditional needles, septa, and other connectors used for transferring hazardous drugs (HDs). NIOSH recommends using CSTDs to limit occupational exposure to hazardous materials and sharps when compounding and administering these drugs (NIOSH 2004). One of the engineering challenges associated with CSTDs is management of the headspace that is either compressed or displaced when transferring liquids in and out of drug vials. CSTD designs and components employing various technologies include creating a physical barrier to contain the displaced volume of air or filters to clean the displaced volume of air when transferring HD solutions. In 2015, NIOSH developed a protocol to test material containment of barrier type CSTDs (NIOSH 2015). NIOSH presented a plan to update the testing protocol so that it was applicable to both barrier and air cleaning types of CSTDs (NIOSH 2016). Both barrier type CSTDs and air cleaning type CSTDs may be susceptible to either liquid or headspace vapor leaks. Air-cleaning type CSTDs allow free passage of air but are expected to remove semi-volatile hazardous drugs (HD)s from the exiting airstream. Barrier type CSTDs have been designed to contain air rather than clean it, and it is reasonable to conclude that a headspace leak with a barrier type CSTD would contain the drug at the same concentration as the headspace inside the vial. As a result, the procedure described in this paper can adequately assess the efficacy of barrier type CSTDs based on the volume of liquid and headspace vapor leak measured. However, the volatile compounds used in this procedure will readily pass through an air-cleaning CSTD, regardless of the ability to retain a semi-volatile HD. Therefore, testing the efficacy of an air-cleaning CSTD requires coupling the procedure described herein with an assessment of the ability of air cleaning CSTDs to retain an appropriate semi-volatile surrogate when volumes of headspace containing that surrogate are passed through the CSTDs. The difference in the amount of HD contained in liquid versus headspace vapor leaks may be several orders of magnitude. The work presented herein is a test method that can distinguish the origin and volumetric quantity of liquid and headspace vapor leaked.\n\nCSTD evaluation involves operation of CSTDs during normal use tasks, such as transferring a solution between two drug vials (NIOSH 2015). A test solution containing two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acetone and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), was used in the evaluation. Leaks were measured by detecting the VOCs in a glove chamber using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) as the detector. Liquid and headspace leaks are differentiated by the ratios of the two VOCs measured as a result of leaks from the CSTD. The compounds, acetone and MTBE, at equal concentrations in a test solution have a concentration ratio in the headspace vapor of the test solution that is very different, as predicted by their Henry\u2019s constants. The ratio of acetone to MTBE detected in the glove chamber can be used to elucidate the source, liquid or headspace, and the magnitude of a leak. The analytical strategy is similar to stable isotope mixing models used to determine contributions from various sources by measuring isotopic ratios (Phillips and Gregg 2001). Propylene glycol (PG) was included in the testing solution as a surrogate for a HD component, though it was not quantified. Fluorescein was included as a visual qualitative indicator of a liquid leak location. SIFT-MS offers low limits of detection and real-time response. The real-time response has the benefit of enabling leaks to be temporally correlated with tasks involving manipulation of CSTD components.",

      "name": "Controlled Generation of Peracetic Acid Atmospheres for the Evaluation of Chemical Samplers",
      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "The goal of the experimental design and research presented herein was to produce peracetic acid (PAA) atmospheres suitable for evaluating PAA sampling methods in a controlled environment. To achieve this, generated test atmospheres must: enable simultaneous exposure of multiple samplers to equivalent atmospheres; maintain a continuous stable atmosphere for a duration to exceed experimental time frames; and produce a range of analyte concentrations, air velocities, temperatures and humidities. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (AGCIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for PAA is 0.4 ppm. The goal was to generate PAA atmospheres with concentrations from one tenth of the TLV up to 100 times the TLV.\n\nPAA is a reactive chemical, which presents some inherent challenges to generation of standard reference materials and atmospheres. PAA is a strong oxidant. PAA solutions are labile, thus it is difficult to keep reference standards or atmospheres. In solution, PAA and water are in equilibrium with acetic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). The equilibrium shifts as solutions of PAA evolve oxygen gas through the degradation of HP. Dynamic PAA atmospheres which are flowing and continuously refreshed are the preferred method for exposing samplers to equivalent atmospheres. Generation of static atmospheres by evaporating PAA solution into a closed container cannot be maintained for very long before needing to be refreshed. Dynamically generated atmospheres are created by a continuously renewed flow of air as a carrier and a source of PAA vapors, which are necessary for evaluating sensor performance over time frames relevant to occupational safety.\n\nGeneration of PAA vapors can be accomplished from assisted vaporization, including applying heat and/or aerosolization with a nebulizer to accelerate evaporation. Glass reacts with PAA to hydroxylate the silica. used a glass syringe to deliver PAA solution to a nebulizer; however, gas bubbles formed in the syringe leading to uncontrollable ejection of the PAA solution from the syringe. To mitigate this, used acid washed syringes. They generated atmospheres of up to 2 ppm with a reported 95% recovery of theoretical delivered PAA. Dilute solutions of PAA can help to mitigate gas evolution but require more energy to evaporate and introduce additional humidity.\n\nFor these experiments, PAA vapors were swept directly from the headspace above a PAA solution into our generation system. The flow rate of the air sweeping the headspace was varied to achieve the desired concentration after dilution into the carrier gas stream. When evaporating diluted PAA solutions using a nebulizer, the minimum humidity range is limited due to the water content in the dilute PAA solution. Thus, a wider humidity range on the low end is available when sweeping the headspace. The ability to maintain the concentration of PAA in the headspace above the solution is limited by the kinetics at the PAA solution-air interface. A practical solution was achieved using a PAA delivery system where air was passed through the headspace above a PAA solution in a vial. An impinger with a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analysis was used as the reference measurement for the PAA concentrations in the generated atmospheres.",

      "description": "Masks block aerosols produced during coughs and exhalations (\u201csource control\u201d). Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (\u201csource\u201d) and a breathing simulator (\u201crecipient\u201d) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.",

      "description": "MicroRNAs are essential regulators of gene expression in humans and can control pathogenesis and host-virus interactions. Notably, the role of specific miRNAs during influenza virus infections are still ill-defined. The central goal of this study was to identify novel miRNAs and their target genes in response to influenza virus infections in airway epithelium. Human airway epithelial cells exposed to influenza virus induced several novel miRNAs that were identified using next generation sequencing (NGS) and their target genes by biochemical methods. NGS analysis predicted forty-two RNA sequences as possible miRNAs based on computational algorithms. Expression patterns of these putative miRNAs were further confirmed using RT-PCR in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) exposed to H1N1, H9N1(1P10) and H9N1 (1WF10) strains of influenza virus. A time course study showed significant downregulation of put-miR-34 in H1N1 and put-miR-35 in H9N1(1P10) infected cells, consistent with the NGS data. Additionally put-miR-34, and put-miR-35 showed a high fold enrichment in argonaute-immunoprecipitation compared to the controls, indicating their ability to form a complex with argonaute protein and RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), a typical mode of action found with miRNAs. Our earlier studies have shown that replication and survival of influenza virus is modulated by certain transcription factors, such as, NF-\u0138B. To identify the target(s) of these putative miRNAs, we screened 84 transcription factors that have a role in viral pathogenesis. Cells transfected with mimic of the put-miR-34 showed significant decrease in expression of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and the inhibitor of put-miR-34 showed significant increase in STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation. In addition, put-miR-34 had 76% homology to the untranslated region (UTR) of STAT3. NGS and PCR array data submitted to the Gene Ontology also predicted the role of transcription factors modulated by put-miR-34. Our data suggests that put-miR-34 could be a good target for the antiviral therapy as the hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in viral disease, as tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health.",

Increased incidence of allergic diseases is thought to be caused, in part, due to occupational exposure to chemicals that induce or augment Th2 immune responses. However, whether exposure to these chemical antimicrobials can influence immune responses to respiratory pathogens is unknown. Here, we use a BALB/c murine model to test if the Th2-promoting antimicrobial chemical triclosan influences immune responses to influenza A virus. Mice were dermally exposed to 2% triclosan for 7 days prior to infection with a sub-lethal dose of mouse adapted PR8 A(H1N1) virus (50 pfu); triclosan exposure continued until 10 days post infection (dpi). Infected mice exposed to triclosan did not show an increase in morbidity or mortality, and viral titers were unchanged. Assessment of T cell responses at 10 dpi showed a decrease in the number of total and activated (CD44hi) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the site of infection (BAL and lung) in triclosan exposed mice compared to controls. Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed using MHCI and MHCII tetramers, with reduced populations, although not reaching statistical significance at these sites following triclosan exposure. Reductions in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet were seen in both activated and tetramer+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs of triclosan exposed infected mice, indicating reduced Th1 polarization and providing a potential mechanism for numerical reduction in T cells. Overall, these results indicate that the immune environment induced by triclosan exposure has the potential to influence the developing immune response to a respiratory viral infection and may have implications for healthcare workers who may be at an increased risk for developing infectious diseases.",

The data presented were collected using an established animal model of vibration-induced white finger (Welcome et al. 2008) to determine if changes in blood flow induced by vibration exposure could be used as a biomarker for the development of vibration-induced peripheral vascular disease. Two separate experiments were done.

According to a study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), EMTs and paramedics have higher fatality rates when compared to all workers, with forty-five percent of EMT deaths resulting from highway incidents, primarily due to vehicle collisions.1 Data from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration showed that among the persons killed in crashes involving an ambulance between 1992 and 2011, twenty one percent were EMTs and patients, while four percent were ambulance drivers.2 To reduce injury potential to the EMTs and other ambulance occupants, NIOSH, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. General Services Administration, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, along with private industry partners, have committed to improving the workspace design of ambulance patient compartments for safe and effective perfo",

HHEs are requested by employees or their representatives, or employers, to help learn whether health hazards are present at their workplace. The scope of HHEs varies based on the requestors\u2019 concerns and the NIOSH project officers\u2019 professional judgment. Only noise measurement results are included in this database; however, many HHEs include evaluation of exposures other than noise. Individual HHE reports are published on the NIOSH website. When available, the database provides a direct link to the HHE report for each of the noise measurement results.\n\nThe noise database contains workplace noise measurement results from 77 HHE reports, including over 808 personal noise exposure measurements and 582 area noise measurements. It also includes the following information: U.S. state or territory; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) region; National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) sector; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; facility description; type of dosimeter or sound level meter used; whether a hearing conservation program was in place; whether a hearing protection was used; whether octave band data was collected; job title; noise-generating activities; location of noise measurements; start and end date for site visit; type (full-shift, partial-shift, or task-based) and duration of noise measurement; type of noise (continuous, impulsive, or intermittent); exposure to ototoxic chemicals; and results in decibels A-weighted (dBA) and percent dose according to OSHA and NIOSH noise measurement criteria. This database is an ongoing project and will be updated at least yearly to add the most recent HHE noise measurement data.",

      "description": "The April 20, 2010, explosion and collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts of tens of thousands of workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted health hazard evaluations (HHEs) of Deepwater Horizon Response onshore and offshore workers. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. Environmental air samples were collected in support of the goals.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted the following exposure evaluations:\n\n- We conducted evaluations on board vessels releasing dispersant. These vessels were deployed to perform small\u2010scale releases of dispersant in an area with surface oil contamination.\n- We assessed exposures during in\u2010situ (i.e., on site) burns of surface oil.\n- We assessed exposures on fishing and shrimping trawlers in the Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program that were assigned to remove surface oil by booming and skimming.\n- We assessed exposures aboard vessels located at the Deepwater Horizon incident site.\n- We assessed exposures during boom and vessel decontamination operations.",

Logistic model fitting indicated that between 2% and 12% of miners exposed to a 2-mg/m3 dust environment in bituminous coal mines would be expected to have Category 2 or greater CWP after a 40-yr working life; PMF would be expected for between 1.3% and 6.7%. The risks for anthracite miners appeared to be greater. There was a suggestion of a background level of abnormality, not associated with dust exposure, but increasing with age.

Prevalence of CWP was related to estimated cumulative dust exposure, age, and rank of coal. On the basis of these data, miners of medium to low rank coal, who work for 40 years at the current federal dust limit of 2 mg/m3, are predicted to have a 1.4% risk of having progressive massive fibrosis on retirement. Higher prevalences are predicted for less severe categories of CWP. Miners in high rank coal areas appear to be at greater risk than those mining medium and low rank coals. Ex-miners who said that they left mining for health-related reasons had higher levels of abnormality compared to current miners.",

HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.  Blood flow (laser doppler) and sensitivity of the tail to pressure (Randall-Selitto pressure test) was measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of the exposure.  The sensitivity of the tail nerves to electrical stimulation was measured on days 2 and 9.",

      "description": "The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)\u2014Teen was a follow-back survey of Sample Children ages 12-17 years old (herein teen) for whom a parent completed the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and also provided permission for the teen to participate. NHIS\u2014Teen is a self-administered survey that teens completed themselves either on the web or paper (mailed). Recruitment for NHIS\u2014Teen occurred July 2021\u2014December 2023 during the NHIS Sample Child interview. Teens with permission received an invitation to go online and complete a questionnaire about their own health. Mailed paper questionnaires were sent to nonrespondents. Questions were included to test concordance with parent-reported responses, address time-sensitive data needs, assess public health attitudes or behaviors, and contribute to developmental work to understand differences between parent and self-reported measures of health. \n\nThe majority of NHIS\u2014Teen survey content focused on the health behaviors, social and emotional wellbeing, and healthcare experiences of teens. Detailed sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. health insurance coverage type, family income) as reported by the parent in the NHIS Sample Child interview can be linked to NHIS\u2014Teen. NHIS\u2014Teen was a pilot survey with data collection concluding in March 2024. There are currently no plans to field additional iterations.",

In June 2024, the ACIP voted to recommend a single dose of RSV vaccine for all adults 75 years and older and adults 60\u201374 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. The data below captures ever receiving a dose of an RSV vaccine by adults 60 years and older.",

      "description": "This dataset represents preliminary weekly estimates of cumulative U.S. COVID-19-associated hospitalizations for the 2024-2025 period. The weekly cumulatve COVID-19 \u2013associated hospitalization estimates are preliminary, and use reported weekly hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The data are updated week-by-week as new COVID-19 hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the COVID-NET system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of COVID-19 -associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7]. \n \n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent COVID-19-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

      "description": "During the 2022-23 and 2023-24 respiratory illness seasons, the Respiratory Virus Laboratory Emergency Department Network Surveillance (RESP-LENS) system gathered electronic health record (EHR) data from nearly 100 hospitals associated with 24 participating sites located in 20 states and the District of Columbia. There was at least one site in each of the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. RESP-LENS collected reports of emergency department (ED) visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and corresponding viral testing results for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza (flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  Sites reported data for an average of approximately 77,000 ED visits weekly, of which 11,000 were associated with ARI and 4,000 of those were in children younger than 18 years.  Between May 2023 and August 2024, these data were posted to CDC's RESP-LENS public dashboard, showing number tested, number positive, and percent positive for each of the three viruses mentioned, by virus, region, and age group.  Due to budget constraints, RESP-LENS was not funded beyond the end of the 2024 fiscal year.  RESP-LENS served as a valuable tool for public health and health care professionals and allowed users to visualize and understand trends in virus circulation, estimate disease burden, respond to outbreaks, and inform decisions and strategies for protecting public health.",

      "description": "The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) Health Center Component, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), collects annual data on visits to health centers to describe patterns of utilization and provision of ambulatory care delivery in the United States. Health centers are local clinics that are community-based and provide comprehensive health care services to populations that are often vulnerable and underserved. Health centers are either federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which receive federal funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), or FQHC look-alikes, which meet HRSA requirements but do not receive HRSA funding.\n\nThis visualization depicts preliminary, biannual counts and rates of health center visits from January 2022-June 2023 by medical diagnosis chapters, stratified by selected patient characteristics. This visualization also depicts measures related to maternal health care at health centers to help expand the availability of data related to maternal health and maternal morbidity.",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2017\u20132021 or 2016\u20132020 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2c3deb0c05a748b391ea8c9cf9903588",

      "description": "Foodborne outbreak investigations often provide data for public health officials to determine how the environment contributed to the outbreak and on how to prevent future outbreaks. State and local health departments are responsible for investigating foodborne illness outbreaks in their jurisdictions and reporting the data to national-level surveillance systems, including information from the environmental assessment. This assessment is designed to describe how the environment contributed to the outbreak and identifies factors that contributed to the outbreak and environmental antecedents to the outbreak. Environmental antecedents, also referred to as root causes, are specific reasons that allow biological or chemical agents to contaminate, survive, or grow in food. From 2017 \u2013 2019, 24 jurisdictions reported 1,430 antecedents from 393 outbreaks to the National Environmental Assessments Reporting System. The most reported antecedents were lack of oversight of employees/enforcement of policies (89.1%), lack of training of employees on specific processes (74.0%), and lack of a food safety culture/attitude towards food safety (57.5%). These findings highlight the critical role that employees play in restaurant food safety and are heavily influenced by restaurant management, who can exercise active managerial control to manage these antecedents. Identifying antecedents during investigations is essential for understanding the outbreak\u2019s root cause and implementing sustainable corrective actions to stop the immediate outbreak and future outbreaks.",

      "description": "The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is designed to meet the need for objective, reliable information about the provision and use of ambulatory medical care services in the United States. NAMCS began in 1973 as a national probability sample survey of visits to nonfederally employed office-based physicians. NCHS conducted the survey annually through 1981, again in 1985, and annually through 2021 (collection of visit data from physicians was stopped during 2020\u20132021 due to the burden placed on respondents by the COVID-19 pandemic). In 2006, a separate sample of Community Health Centers (CHCs) was added to the survey; the CHC component samples visits to both physicians and advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners, PAs [physician assistants and physician associates], and certified nurse midwives). Starting in 2012, in addition to the traditional NAMCS file, a separate data file for CHCs including physicians and advanced practice providers has been released.\n\nIn 2021, the former CHC sample of NAMCS was redesigned and launched as the NAMCS Health Center (HC) Component, collecting visit data from HCs using electronic health records, or EHR, systems of the participating health centers. The NAMCS Health Center Component contains critical data about health centers and the care they provide.",

      "description": "This data presents counts of provisional drug overdose deaths by selected drugs and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) public health regions, based on provisional mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System. This data is limited to drug overdose deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers X40-X44 (unintentional), X60-X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10-Y14 (undetermined intent). Specific drugs were identified using methods for searching literal text from death certificates. \n\nThe provisional data are based on a current flow of mortality data and include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of drug overdose deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and specified drug. Provisional drug overdose death counts presented on this page are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2022 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2021 and June 2022), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods.

Data collection from hospital-based ambulatory surgery centers began in 2009. And between 2010 and 2012 NHAMCS gathered data on visits to freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. In 2018, the survey began focusing on just the ambulatory visits made to emergency departments.\nEach emergency department is randomly assigned to a 4-week reporting period. During this period, data for a systematic random sample of visits are recorded by Census interviewers using a computerized Patient Record Form. Data are obtained on patient characteristics such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and visit characteristics such as patient\u2019s reason for visit, provider\u2019s diagnosis, services ordered or provided, and treatments, including medication therapy. In addition, data about the facility are collected as part of a survey induction interview.",

NEHRS began in 2008 and was originally designed as an annual mail supplement to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Since 2012, NEHRS has been administered as a survey independent of NAMCS.\nData from NEHRS can be used to produce state and national estimates of EHR adoption and capabilities, burden associated with EHRs, and progress physicians have made towards meeting the policy goals of the HITECH Act. In more recent years, survey questions have also asked about Promoting Interoperability programs, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).",

      "description": "In 2020, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) partnered with the Census Bureau on an experimental data system called the Household Pulse Survey. This survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about how emergent issues are impacting American households. Beginning in Phase 4.0 (on January 9, 2024), questions on social support, loneliness, and social isolation were added to the survey. These questions have been included on other nationally representative surveys. Briefly, the question on social support was included on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from July 2020-December 2021 and was added to the 2024 NHIS. The question on loneliness was added to the 2024 NHIS. The questions on social isolation are adapted from the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index and were included on an earlier cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

      "description": "Data from influenza A virus (IAV) infected ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) provides invaluable information towards the study of novel and emerging viruses that pose a threat to human health. This gold standard animal model can recapitulate many clinical signs of infection present in IAV-infected humans, support virus replication of human and zoonotic strains without prior adaptation, and permit evaluation of virus transmissibility by multiple modes. While ferrets have been employed in risk assessment settings for >20 years, results from this work are typically reported in discrete stand-alone publications, making aggregation of raw data from this work over time nearly impossible. Here, we describe a dataset of 728 ferrets inoculated with 126 unique IAV, conducted by a single research group (NCIRD/ID/IPB/Pathogenesis Laboratory Team) under a uniform experimental protocol. This collection of morbidity, mortality, and viral titer data represents the largest publicly available dataset to date of in vivo-generated IAV infection outcomes on a per-individual ferret level.\n\nPublished Data Descriptor for more information:\nKieran TJ, Sun X, Creager HM, Tumpey TM, Maine TR, Belser JA. 2024.

The redesigned survey was administered using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) system and included a supplemental survey of nursing assistants employed by nursing homes, the National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS), which was sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (APSE). \n\nThe National Nursing Home Survey provides information on nursing homes from two perspectives-that of the provider of services and that of the recipient of care. Data about the facilities include characteristics such as size, ownership, Medicare/Medicaid certification, services provided and specialty programs offered, and charges. For recipients, data were obtained on demographic characteristics, health status and medications taken, services received, and sources of payment.\n\nData for the survey were obtained through personal interviews with facility administrators and designated staff who used administrative records to answer questions about the facilities, staff, services and programs, and medical records to answer questions about the residents.\n\nThe total number of nursing home facilities that participated in NNHS is 1,174 and the total number of nursing assistants that participated in the National Nursing Assistant Survey is 3,017.",

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.\u202f \n\nNote that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. \n\nMore information on HSAs is available <a href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html\"><b>here</b></a>.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as \u201csparse\u201d.  \n\nFor additional information, please see: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n\nUpdated once per week on Fridays.\u202f",

      "description": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel human coronavirus that was identified in 2019. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in an acute, severe respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis, which continues to affect populations across the globe. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the reference standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis. Serological tests are valuable tools for serosurveillance programs and establishing correlates of protection from disease. This study evaluated the performance of one in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing the pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), two commercially available chemiluminescence assays Ortho VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and one commercially available Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT), GenScript USA Inc., cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.  Using a panel of rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients\u2019 sera and a negative control group as a reference standard, all three immunoassays demonstrated high comparable positivity rates and low discordant rates.  All three immunoassays were highly sensitive with estimated sensitivities ranging from 95.4%-96.6%. ROC curve analysis indicated that all three immunoassays had high diagnostic accuracies with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.9698-0.9807. High positive correlation was demonstrated among the conventional microneutralization test (MNT) titers and the sVNT inhibition percent values.  Our study indicates that independent evaluations are necessary to optimize the overall utility and the interpretation of the results of serological tests.  Overall, we demonstrate that all serological tests evaluated in this study are suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.",

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.\n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly.\n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",

      "description": "2023 Respiratory Viruses Response \u2013 National Syndromic Surveillance Program Emergency Department Visit Trajectories - COVID-19, Flu, RSV, Combined \u2013 by state. This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geography that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time both as of the given row date and as of the most current data submitted is characterized as increasing, decreasing or stable to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on the opening page are based on rolling regression model assessments of the slope for each respiratory illness. Weeks with a significant time term (p <0.05) are classified as increasing when the slope is positive and decreasing when the slope is negative. Weeks with a non-significant time term (p \u2265 0.05) are classified as stable. A 3-week moving average is applied to the time series prior to the regression procedure in order to smooth week-to-week variation. \n<br>\nFor additional information, please see:<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n<br>\nUpdated once per week on Fridays.",

The percent of tests positive is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the total number of tests administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive tests/total tests) x 100]. These data include percent of tests positive values for the detection of severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a sentinel network of laboratories located through the US, includes clinical, public health and commercial laboratories; additional information available at: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html. Influenza results include clinical laboratory test results from NREVSS and influenza collaborating laboratories; more details about influenza virologic surveillance are available here:\u202fhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.html. \n\nData represent calculations based on laboratory tests performed, not individual people tested. RSV and COVID-19 are limited to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), also listed as polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR). Participating laboratories report weekly to CDC the total number of RSV tests performed that week and the number of those tests that were positive. The RSV trend graphs display the national average of the weekly % test positivity for the current, previous, and following weeks in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by percent (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.",

      "description": "The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) has been fielded annually since 1992 to collect data on the utilization and provision of ambulatory care services in hospital emergency and outpatient departments. Data collection from hospital-based ambulatory surgery centers began in 2009. And between 2010 and 2012 NHAMCS gathered data on visits to freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. In 2018, the survey began focusing on just the ambulatory visits made to emergency departments.\nEach emergency department is randomly assigned to a 4-week reporting period. During this period, data for a systematic random sample of visits are recorded by Census interviewers using a computerized Patient Record Form. Data are obtained on patient characteristics such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and visit characteristics such as patient\u2019s reason for visit, provider\u2019s diagnosis, services ordered or provided, and treatments, including medication therapy. In addition, data about the facility are collected as part of a survey induction interview.",

For updated data, please refer to the <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html\"><b>ILINet State Activity Indicator Map</b></a>.\n\nInformation on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI) is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet consists of outpatient healthcare providers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More than 100 million patient visits were reported during the 2022-23 season. Each week, more than 3,000 outpatient health care providers around the country report to CDC the number of patient visits for ILI by age group (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and \u226565 years) and the total number of visits for any reason. A subset of providers also reports total visits by age group. For this system, ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100\u00b0F [37.8\u00b0C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat. Activity levels are based on the percent of outpatient visits due to ILI in a jurisdiction compared to the average percent of ILI visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation (non-influenza weeks) in that jurisdiction. The number of sites reporting each week is variable; therefore, baselines are adjusted each week based on which sites within each jurisdiction provide data. To perform this adjustment, provider level baseline ILI ratios are calculated for those that have a sufficient reporting history. Providers that do not have the required reporting history to calculate a provider-specific baseline are assigned the baseline ratio for their practice type. The jurisdiction level baseline is then calculated using a weighted sum of the baseline ratios for each contributing provider. \n\nThe activity levels compare the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during the current week to the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during non-influenza weeks. The 13 activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at, or above the mean for the current week compared with the mean during non-influenza weeks. Activity levels are classified as minimal (levels 1-3), low (levels 4-5), moderate (levels 6-7), high (levels 8-10), and very high (levels 11-13). An activity level of 1 corresponds to an ILI percentage below the mean, level 2 corresponds to an ILI percentage less than 1 standard deviation above the mean, level 3 corresponds to an ILI percentage more than 1 but less than 2 standard deviations above the mean, and so on, with an activity level of 10 corresponding to an ILI percentage 8 to 11 standard deviations above the mean. The very high levels correspond to an ILI percentage 12 to 15 standard deviations above the mean for level 11, 16 to 19 standard deviations above the mean for level 12, and 20 or more standard deviations above the mean for level 13. \n\nDisclaimers: \n\nThe ILI Activity Indicator map reflects the intensity of ILI activity, not the extent of geographic spread of ILI, within a jurisdiction. Therefore, outbreaks occurring in a single area could cause the entire jurisdiction to display high or very high activity levels. In addition, data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of respiratory illness activity for the entire jurisdiction. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being more complete. \n\nMore information is available on <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html\">FluView Interactive</a>.",

      "description": "More than 450 public health, clinical, and commercial laboratories located throughout the United States voluntarily participate in surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). The data contain weekly, aggregate counts of RSV tests performed and RSV detections as reported to NREVSS since April 11, 2020. \n\nNREVSS data are reported weekly at the national and 10 HHS regional levels (https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html). The presented data are RSV Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. Less than 5% of RSV tests reported to NREVSS are from antigen tests. All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the most recent weeks, but relatively complete (>90%) for the period up to 2 weeks earlier. \n\nPercent positivity is a surveillance metric used to monitor RSV activity over time and by geographic area. Participating laboratories send weekly reports of the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts reflect the latest data reported to NREVSS and may differ from data presented by public health jurisdictions. Public health jurisdictions may have additional data not reported to NREVSS and may use a different reporting cadence. The RSV trend graphs display the weekly average percent of tests positive for RSV among all the tests performed. Each point on the regional table displays the average number of RSV tests that were performed, and the average percent of those that were positive during a 3-week period (i.e., the specified week, and the weeks immediately preceding and following it). This is also known as a centered, 3-week moving average. The RSV detections displayed are the 5-week moving average (average of the 4 previous and current weeks) in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by detections (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). \n\nNREVSS strives to present precise estimates of respiratory viral trends and minimize reporting burden for participating laboratories. However, there are several limitations to this surveillance system. NREVSS is a laboratory-based surveillance system that does not have patient-specific data; multiple tests from a single patient may be included. In addition, NREVSS does not collect demographic or clinical data (i.e., hospitalizations or deaths). Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Laboratories from all 50 states report data weekly, but reporting is voluntary and may not be representative of local RSV activity. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all RSV NAATs administered regionally or nationally. Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas and populations served. Geographic results from clinical laboratories are based on testing location and laboratories may test samples from across one or more states.

      "description": "A poor food safety culture has been described as an emerging risk factor for foodborne illness outbreaks, yet there has been little research on this topic in the retail food industry. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate conceptual domains around food safety culture and develop an assessment tool that can be used to assess food workers\u2019 perceptions of their restaurant\u2019s food safety culture. The study, conducted from March 2018 through March 2019, surveyed restaurant food workers for their level of agreement with 28 statements. We received 579 responses from 331 restaurants spread across eight different health department jurisdictions. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling supported a model composed of four primary constructs. The highest rated construct was Resource Availability (\n=4.69, sd=0.57), which assessed the availability of resources to maintain good hand hygiene. The second highest rated construct was Employee Commitment (=4.49, sd=0.62), which assessed workers\u2019 perceptions of their coworkers\u2019 commitment to food safety. The last two constructs were related to management. Leadership (=4.28, sd=0.69) assessed the existence of food safety policies, training, and information sharing. Management Commitment (=3.94, sd=1.05) assessed whether food safety was a priority in practice. Finally, the model revealed one higher-order construct, Worker Beliefs about Food Safety Culture (=4.35, sd=0.53). The findings from this study can support efforts by the restaurant industry, food safety researchers, and health departments to examine the influence and effects of food safety culture within restaurants.",

An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. \nTo estimate the number of unvaccinated persons in each MMWR week, the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates by jurisdiction and age group were used (except for California, where State Department of Finance 2021 population projections were determined to be more accurate). The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. \nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.",

      "description": "ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all \u201cPatients using their own eggs\u201d or for \u201cPatients with no prior ART using their own eggs.\u201d For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent\u2019s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research\u2014that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",

COVID-19 hospitalization data are reported to CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States. Data reported by hospitals to NHSN and included in this dataset represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to COVID-19 hospital admissions, and inpatient and ICU bed capacity occupancy.\n\n<b>Reporting information:</b><ul><li>As of December 15, 2022, COVID-19 hospital data are required to be reported to  NHSN, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States. Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Prior to December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System (UHDSS). </li><li>While CDC reviews these data for errors and corrects those found, some reporting errors might still exist within the data. To minimize errors and inconsistencies in data reported, CDC removes outliers before calculating the metrics. CDC and partners work with reporters to correct these errors and update the data in subsequent weeks.</li><li>Many hospital subtypes, including acute care and critical access hospitals, as well as Veterans Administration, Defense Health Agency, and Indian Health Service hospitals, are included in the metric calculations provided in this report. Psychiatric, rehabilitation, and religious non-medical hospital types are excluded from calculations.  </li><li>Data are aggregated and displayed for hospitals with the same Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification Number (CCN), which are assigned by CMS to counties based on the CMS Provider of Services files. </li> <li>Full details on COVID-19 hospital data reporting guidance can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf</li></ul>\n<b>Calculation of county-level hospital metrics:</b><ul><li>County-level hospital data are derived using calculations performed at the Health Service Area (HSA) level. An HSA is defined by CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics as a geographic area containing at least one county which is self-contained with respect to the population\u2019s provision of routine hospital care. Every county in the United States is assigned to an HSA, and each HSA must contain at least one hospital. Therefore, use of HSAs in the calculation of local hospital metrics allows for more accurate characterization of the relationship between health care utilization and health status at the local level. </li><li>Data presented at the county-level represent admissions, hospital inpatient and ICU bed capacity and occupancy among hospitals within the selected HSA. Therefore, admissions, capacity, and occupancy are not limited to residents of the selected HSA. </li><li>For all county-level hospital metrics listed below the values are calculated first for the entire HSA, and then the HSA-level value is then applied to each county within the HSA. </li><li>For all county-level hospital metrics listed below the values are calculated first for the entire HSA, and then the HSA-level value is then applied to each county within the HSA. </li></ul>\n<b>Metric details:</b><ul><li><b>Time period:</b> data for the previous MMWR week (Sunday-Saturday) will update weekly on Mondays as soon as they are reviewed and verified, usually before 8 pm ET. Updates will occur the following day when reporting coincides with a federal holiday. Note: Weekly updates might be delayed due to delays in reporting. All data are provisional. Because these provisional counts are subject to change, including updates to data reported previously, adjustments can occur. Data may be updated since original publication due to delays in reporting (to account for data received after a given Thursday publication) or data quality corrections.</li><li><b>New hospital admissions (count):</b> Total number of admissions of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the previous week (including both adult and pediatric admissions) in the entire jurisdiction </li><li><b>New Hospital Admissions Rate Value (Admissions per 100k):</b> Total number of new admissions of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the past week (including both adult and pediatric admissions) for the entire jurisdiction divided by 2019 intercensal population estimate for that jurisdiction multiplied by 100,000.

Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>.

Historic information presented on the COVID Data Tracker pages were based on the same source (Aggregate Data) as the present dataset until the expiration of the public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023; however, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Death Counts</a> are based on death certificate data that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate.  Counts from previous weeks were continually revised as more records were received and processed.\n\n<b>Number of Jurisdictions Reporting</b>\nThere were 60 public health jurisdictions that reported cases and deaths of COVID-19. This included the 50 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands as well as three independent countries in compacts of free association with the United States, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau.

Case and death counts for Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska, represent total cases and deaths in residents of Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska, and Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska. Case and death counts for Bristol Bay Borough, Alaska, are shown as 0 by default. Case and death counts for Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska, represent total cases and deaths in residents of Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska, and Bristol Bay Borough, Alaska.\n\nHistorical cases and deaths are not tracked separately in the county level datasets, and differences in weekly new cases and deaths could exist when county-level data are aggregated to the state-level (i.e., when compared to this dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36).",

      "description": "More than 450 public health and clinical laboratories located throughout the United States participate in surveillance for severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The dataset contains a weekly summary of aggregate counts of the total SARS-CoV-2 tests and SARS-CoV-2 detections reported to NREVSS since March 14, 2020. These data are reported weekly on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed for up to 2 years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.\n\nWhile NREVSS strives to present the most precise estimates of respiratory viral trends with reporting burden minimized for participating laboratories, there are several inherent limitations to this surveillance system.\n\nNREVSS does not collect patient-specific data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested, nor do they directly reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.\n\nFor more information on NREVSS and COVID-19 surveillance please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss. These data appear starting May 25, 2023 on the CDC COVID Data Tracker at the following URLs: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends ; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases.   \n\nNREVSS data are reported at the national and HHS regional levels. The ten (10) U.S. Department of HHS regions are defined here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. \n\nThe data represent SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from a voluntary, sentinel network of participating laboratories in the United States, including clinical, public health and commercial laboratories (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). \n\nThese data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the past 1 week, and more complete (>90%) for the period 2 weeks earlier. \n\nThere are data from all states across the 10 HHS regions. Because the data are from a sentinel network of laboratories, however, results may vary geographically. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all SARS-CoV-2 NAATs administered in the United States. \n\nPercent positivity is one of the surveillance metrics used to monitor COVID-19 transmission over time and by area. Percent positivity is calculated by dividing the number of positive NAATs by the total number of NAATs administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive NAAT tests / total NAAT tests) x 100].\n\nThe data represent laboratory tests performed, not individual (deduplicated) results in people. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts in the data reflect the latest data reported from NREVSS laboratories and may not match the data presented by various jurisdictions.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, CDC discontinued utilizing the COVID electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) platform as the primary laboratory source of COVID-19 results. These data are archived at health.data.gov.\n\nFor more information about NREVSS, please see: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html.",

      "description": "NCHS has linked data from various surveys with death certificate records from the National Death Index (NDI). Linkage of the NCHS survey participant data with the NDI mortality data provides the opportunity to conduct a vast array of outcome studies designed to investigate the association of a wide variety of health factors with mortality. The Linked Mortality Files (LMF) have been updated with mortality follow-up data through December 31, 2019.\n\nPublic-use Linked Mortality Files (LMF) are available for 1986-2018 NHIS, 1999-2018 NHANES, and NHANES III. The files include a limited set of mortality variables for adult participants only. The public-use versions of the NCHS Linked Mortality Files were subjected to data perturbation techniques to reduce the risk of participant re-identification. For select records, synthetic data were substituted for follow-up time or underlying cause of death. Information regarding vital status was not perturbed.",

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. \n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. \n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",

This study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) to identify outbreak investigation characteristics associated with outbreak investigation success. We identified investigation characteristics that increase the probability of successful outbreak investigations: a robust epidemiology investigation method; a thorough environmental assessment, as measured by number of visits to complete the assessment; and the collection of clinical samples. This research highlights the importance of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, which includes epidemiology, environmental health, and laboratory personnel working together to solve the outbreak.",

The NHIS data are used to monitor trends in illness and disability, track progress toward achieving national health objectives, for epidemiologic and policy analysis of various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs. NHIS is conducted continuously throughout the year by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Public-use data files on adults and children with corresponding imputed income data files, and survey paradata are released annually. The NHIS data website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/index.html) features the most up-to-date public-use data files and documentation for downloading including questionnaire, codebooks, CSV and ASCII data files, programs and sample code, and in-depth survey description. Most of the NHIS data are included in the public use files. NHIS is protected by Federal confidentiality laws that state the data collected by NCHS may be used only for statistical reporting and analysis. Some NHIS variables have been suppressed or edited in the public use files to protect confidentiality. Analysts interested in using data that has been suppressed or edited may apply for access through the NCHS Research Data Center at https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/. In 2019, NHIS launched a redesigned content and structure that differs from its previous questionnaire designs. NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957.",

Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across states. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. \n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York, New York City, Puerto Rico; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRates are based on deaths occurring in the specified week/month and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly/monthly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates.  Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",

The survey collects information about policies such as nutrition standards, incentives for healthy food retail, bike/pedestrian-friendly design, and Complete Streets. About 2,000 municipalities respond to the survey. Participating municipalities receive a report that allows them to compare their policies and practices with other municipalities of similar geography, population size, and urban status.\n\nThe CBS HEAL survey was first administered in 2014 and was administered again in 2021. Data is provided in multiple formats for download including as a SAS file. A methods report and a SAS program for formatting the data are also provided.",

      "description": "This data presents national-level provisional maternal mortality rates based on a current flow of mortality and natality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Provisional rates which are an early estimate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, are shown as of the date specified and may not include all deaths and births that occurred during a given time period (see Technical Notes).\n\nA maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. In this data visualization, maternal deaths are those deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers A34, O00\u2013O95, and O98\u2013O99.\n\nThe provisional data  include reported 12 month-ending provisional maternal mortality rates overall, by age, and by race and Hispanic origin. Provisional maternal mortality rates presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2020 would include deaths and births occurring from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2020 and June 2021), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. In the visualization and in the accompanying data file, rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with current NCHS standards of reliability for rates. Death counts between 1-9 in the data file are suppressed in accordance with National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) confidentiality standards.\n\nProvisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received. Previously released estimates are revised to include data and record updates received since the previous release. As a result, the reliability of estimates for a 12-month period ending with a specific month will improve with each quarterly release and estimates for previous time periods may change as new data and updates are received.",

      "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Updated (Bivalent) Booster Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nWebpage: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\n\n\nThese data were posted and archived on May 30, 2023 and reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through April 22, 2023, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through April 1, 2023. These data will no longer be updated after May 2023.\n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with at least a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. A person vaccinated with a primary series and a monovalent booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and at least one additional dose of any monovalent FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. (Note: this definition does not distinguish between vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised and are receiving an additional dose versus those who are not immunocompromised and receiving a booster dose.) A person vaccinated with a primary series and an updated (bivalent) booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected in a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and an additional dose of any bivalent FDA-authorized or approved vaccine COVID-19 vaccine on or after September 1, 2022. (Note: Doses with bivalent doses reported as first or second doses are classified as vaccinated with a bivalent booster dose.) People with primary series or a monovalent booster dose were combined in the \u201cvaccinated without an updated booster\u201d category. \n\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Per the interim guidance of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), this should include persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are primarily reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19. In select jurisdictions, deaths are included that are not laboratory confirmed and are reported based on alternative dates (i.e., onset date for most; or date of death or report date, where onset date is unavailable). Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 24 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (NY), North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia; 23 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 48% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions. This list will be updated as more jurisdictions participate.     \n\nIncidence rate estimates: Weekly age-specific incidence rates by vaccination status were calculated as the number of cases or deaths divided by the number of people vaccinated with a primary series, overall or with/without a booster dose (cumulative) or unvaccinated (obtained by subtracting the cumulative number of people vaccinated with at least a primary series and partially vaccinated people from the 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates) and multiplied by 100,000. Overall incidence rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. To estimate population counts for ages 6-12 months, half of the single-year population counts for ages <12 months were used. All rates are plotted by positive specimen collection date to reflect when incident infections occurred. \n\nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage. \n\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs): IRRs for the past one month were calculated by dividing the average weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by that among people vaccinated without an updated (bivalent) booster dose) or vaccinated with an updated (bivalent) booster dose. \n\nArchive: An archive of historic data, including April 3, 2021-September 24, 2022 and posted on October 21, 2022 is available on data.cdc.gov. The analysis by vaccination status (unvaccinated and at least a primary series) for 31 jurisdictions is posted here: https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/3rge-nu2a.

      "description": "CDC is collaborating with Vitalant Research Institute, American Red Cross, and Westat Inc. to conduct a nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey of blood donors. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies.\nInfection-induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with antibody evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and refers to the percent of the population with anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.\nCombined infection-Induced and Vaccination-Induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with antibody evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both, and refers to the percent of the population that has anti-spike antibodies, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, or both.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

      "description": "The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) is a network that conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age and adults. RSV-NET, along with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) an the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance network (FluSuv-NET), comprise the Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET).  The RESP-NET platforms have overlapping surveillance areas and use similar methods to collect data. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. RSV-NET is CDC\u2019s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with RSV. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area. \n\nData are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.",

      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "Reporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\nThis archived public use dataset contains historical case and percent positivity data updated weekly for all available counties and jurisdictions. Each week, the dataset was refreshed to capture any historical updates. Please note, percent positivity data may be incomplete for the most recent time period.\n\n<b>Related data </b>\nCDC provides the public with two active versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with historical case and percent positivity data for each county from January 22, 2020 (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly Historical Changes dataset</a>) and a dataset with the levels as originally posted (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly Originally Posted dataset</a>) since October 20, 2022. <b>Please navigate to the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly Originally Posted dataset</a> for the Community Transmission Levels published weekly on Thursdays.</b>\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. \n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00). \n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00). \n\n\nThe data in this dataset are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers. \n\nThis dataset is created using <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">CDC\u2019s Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a>.\n\n\n<b>Archived data </b>\nCDC has archived two prior versions of these datasets. Both versions contain the same 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions; however, the datasets updated daily. The archived datasets can be found here:  \n\n<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/8396-v7yb\">Archived Originally Posted dataset</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">Archived Historical Changes dataset </a>\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\n<b>October 27, 2022:</b> Due to a processing issue this dataset will not be posted this week. CDC is currently working to address the issue and will publish the data when able.\n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> As of 11/10/2022, this dataset will continue to incorporate historical updates made to case and percent positivity data; however, community transmission level will only be published in the corresponding Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted dataset (<a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly Originally Posted dataset</a>).\n\n<b>Note:</b>\n\n<b>October 20, 2022:</b> Due to a data reporting error, the\u202fcase rate for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania is lower than expected in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on October 20, 2022. This could lead to the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level for Philadelphia County being underestimated; therefore, it should be interpreted with caution.\u00a0\n\n<b>November 3, 2022:</b> Due to a reporting cadence issue, case rates for Missouri counties are calculated based on 11 days\u2019 worth of case count data in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on November 3, 2022, instead of the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data. This could lead to the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels metrics for Missouri counties being overestimated; therefore, they should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> Due to a reporting cadence change, case rates for Alabama counties are calculated based on 13 days\u2019 worth of case count data in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on November 10, 2022, instead of the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data. This could lead to the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels metrics for Alabama counties being overestimated; therefore, they should be interpreted with caution. \n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> Per the request of the jurisdiction, cases among non-residents have been removed from all Hawaii county totals throughout the entire time series. Cumulative case counts reported by CDC will no longer match Hawaii\u2019s COVID-19 Dashboard, which still includes non-resident cases.\u202f\n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> In the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on November 10, 2022, multiple municipalities in Puerto Rico are reporting higher than expected increases in case counts. CDC is working with territory officials to verify the data submitted.\u202f\n\n<b>December 1, 2022:</b> Due to cadence changes over the Thanksgiving holiday, case rates for all Ohio counties are reported as 0 in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on December 1, 2022. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\u202f\n\n<b>December 22, 2022:</b> Due to an internal revision process, case rates for some Tennessee counties may appear higher than expected in the December 22, 2022, weekly release. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels metrics for some Tennessee counties may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>December 22, 2022:</b> Due to reporting of a backlog of historic COVID-19 cases, case rates for some Louisiana counties will appear higher than expected in the December 22, 2022, weekly release. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels metrics for some Louisiana counties may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>December 29, 2022:</b> Due to technical difficulties, county data from Alabama could not be incorporated via standard practices. As a result, case and death metrics will be reported as 0 in the December 29, 2022, weekly release. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels metrics for Alabama counties will be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>January 5, 2023:</b> Due to a reporting cadence issue, case rates for all Alabama counties will be calculated based on 14 days\u2019 worth of case count data in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level information released on January 5, 2023, instead of the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of case count data. Therefore, the weekly case rates will be overestimated, which could affect counties\u2019 COVID-19 Community Transmission Level classification and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>January 5, 2023:</b> Due to North Carolina\u2019s holiday reporting cadence, aggregate case data will contain 14 days\u2019 worth of data instead of the customary 7 days. As a result, case metrics will appear higher than expected in the January 5, 2023, weekly release. COVID-19 Community Transmission metrics may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>January 12, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case data will be reported as 0. As a result, case metrics will appear lower than expected in the January 12, 2023, weekly release. COVID-19 Community Transmission metrics may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\u202f\n\n<b>January 13, 2023:</b> Aggregate case data released for Los Angeles County, California for the week of December 22nd, 2022, and December 29th, 2022, have been corrected for a data processing error.\n\n<b>January 19, 2023:</b> Due to a reporting cadence issue, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case data will be calculated based on 14 days\u2019 worth of data instead of the customary 7 days in the January 19, 2023, weekly release. Therefore, COVID-19 Community Transmission metrics may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b>\u202fDue to a\u202freporting backlog of historic COVID-19 cases, case\u202frates\u202ffor\u202ftwo Michigan counties (Livingston and Washtenaw) were higher than expected in the January 19, 2023 weekly release. Community Transmission metrics for those counties may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.  \n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b> Due to a backlog of historic COVID-19 cases being reported this week, aggregate case counts in Charlotte County and Sarasota County, Florida, will appear higher than expected in the January 26, 2023 weekly release. Community Transmission metrics for those counties may be overestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case data will be reported as 0 in the weekly release posted on January 26, 2023. As a result, case metrics will appear lower than expected, and the Community Transmission metrics for all Mississippi counties may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>February 2, 2023:</b> As of the data collection deadline, CDC observed an abnormally large increase in aggregate COVID-19 cases reported for Washington State. In response, totals for new cases released on February 2, 2023, have been displayed as zero at county level until the issue is addressed with state officials. Because case rates will be reported as zero for the current week, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels for all counties in Washington State may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution. CDC is working with state officials to address the issue.\n\n<b>February 2, 2023:</b> Due to a decrease reported in cumulative case counts, case rates for several Wyoming counties will be reported as 0 in the February 2, 2023, weekly release. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels for several Wyoming counties may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution. CDC is working with state officials to verify the data submitted.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 2, 2023:</b> Due to a backlog of historic COVID-19 cases being reported this week, case rates for East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana will appear higher than expected in the data released on February 2, 2023. This could lead to the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level for this county being overestimated, and it should be interpreted with caution.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 9, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, the case rates for all Mississippi counties will be reported as 0 in the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level data released on February 9, 2023. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels for all Mississippi counties may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\n\n<b>February 9, 2023:</b> Due to a decrease reported in cumulative case counts, the case rate for Richmond City, Virginia, will be reported as 0 in the February 9, 2023, release. Therefore, the COVID-19 Community Transmission Level for this county may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution. CDC is working with state officials to verify the data submitted.\n\n<b>February 16, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Utah\u2019s aggregate case data will be reported as 0 in the weekly release posted on February 16, 2023. As a result, case metrics will appear lower than expected. Community Transmission metrics may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 16, 2023:</b> Due to a reporting cadence change, Maine\u2019s aggregate case data may contain less than the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data in the February 16, 2023, release. Therefore, Community Transmission metrics may be underestimated and should be interpreted with caution.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 16, 2023:</b> Due to a suspected data reporting cadence change, the case rates for all New Mexico counties may be lower than expected in the data released on February 16, 2023. This may lead to the COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels for all New Mexico counties being underestimated; therefore, they should be interpreted with caution. CDC is working with state officials to verify the data submitted.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 23, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Hawaii\u2019s aggregate case data will be reported as 0.

Each week, the dataset was refreshed to capture any historical updates. Please note, percent positivity data may be incomplete for the most recent time period.\n\nThis archived public use dataset contains weekly community transmission levels data for all available counties and jurisdictions since October 20, 2022. The dataset was appended to contain the most recent week's data as originally posted on COVID Data Tracker. Historical corrections are not made to these data if new case or testing information become available.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. \n \n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00). \n \n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00). \n \nIf the two metrics suggest different transmission levels, the higher level is selected. \n \nThe reported transmission categories include: \n \nLow Transmission Threshold: Counties with fewer than 10 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, and a NAAT percent test positivity in the past 7 days below 5%; \n \nModerate Transmission Threshold: Counties with 10-49 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 5.0-7.99%; \n \nSubstantial Transmission Threshold: Counties with 50-99 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 8.0-9.99%; \n \nHigh Transmission Threshold: Counties with 100 or more total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 10.0% or greater. \n \nBlank: total new cases in the past 7 days are not reported (county data known to be unavailable) and the percentage of positive NAATs tests during the past 7 days (blank) are not reported. \n\n\nThe data in this dataset are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers. \n\nThis dataset is created using CDC\u2019s\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a>.\n\n\n<b>Archived data </b>\nCDC has archived two prior versions of these datasets.

This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status. Instead, confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available. Not all jurisdictions report probable cases and deaths to CDC.* Confirmed and probable case definition criteria are described here: \n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/ps2022/22-ID-01_COVID19.pdf\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (ymaws.com).</a>\n\n<b>Deaths</b>\nCDC reports death data on other sections of the website: <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home\"> CDC COVID Data Tracker: Home</a>, <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#cases_casesper100klast7days\">CDC COVID Data Tracker: Cases, Deaths, and Testing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts</a>. Information presented on the COVID Data Tracker pages is based on the same source (total case counts) as the present dataset; however, NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed.\n\n<b>Number of Jurisdictions Reporting </b>\nThere are currently 60 public health jurisdictions reporting cases of COVID-19. This includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands as well as three independent countries in compacts of free association with the United States, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau. New York State\u2019s reported case and death counts do not include New York City\u2019s counts as they separately report nationally notifiable conditions to CDC. \n\nCDC COVID-19 data are available to the public as summary or aggregate count files, including total counts of cases and deaths, available  by state and by county. These and other data on COVID-19 are available from multiple public locations, such as: \n \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html \n \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html \n \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html \n \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/surveillance-data-analytics.html \n\nAdditional COVID-19 public use datasets, include line-level (patient-level) data, are available at: https://data.cdc.gov/browse?tags=covid-19.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\n<b>November 3, 2022:</b> Due to a reporting cadence issue, case rates for Missouri counties are calculated based on 11 days\u2019 worth of case count data in the Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State data released on November 3, 2022, instead of the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data.\n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> Due to a reporting cadence change, case rates for Alabama counties are calculated based on 13 days\u2019 worth of case count data in the Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State data released on November 10, 2022, instead of the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data.\n\n<b>November 10, 2022:</b> Per the request of the jurisdiction, cases and deaths among non-residents have been removed from all Hawaii county totals throughout the entire time series. Cumulative case and death counts reported by CDC will no longer match Hawaii\u2019s COVID-19 Dashboard, which still includes non-resident cases and deaths.\u202f\n\n<b>November 17, 2022:</b> Two new columns, weekly historic cases and weekly historic deaths, were added to this dataset on November 17, 2022. These columns reflect case and death counts that were reported that week but were historical in nature and not reflective of the current burden within the jurisdiction.  These historical cases and deaths are not included in the new weekly case and new weekly death columns; however, they are reflected in the cumulative totals provided for each jurisdiction. These data are used to account for artificial increases in case and death totals due to batched reporting of historical data.\n\n<b>December 1, 2022:</b> Due to cadence changes over the Thanksgiving holiday, case rates for all Ohio counties are reported as 0 in the data released on December 1, 2022.\n\n<b>January 5, 2023:</b> Due to North Carolina\u2019s holiday reporting cadence, aggregate case and death data will contain 14 days\u2019 worth of data instead of the customary 7 days. As a result, case and death metrics will appear higher than expected in the January 5, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>January 12, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected in the January 12, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>January 19, 2023:</b> Due to a reporting cadence issue, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be calculated based on 14 days\u2019 worth of data instead of the customary 7 days in the January 19, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b> Due to a\u202freporting backlog of historic COVID-19 cases, case\u202frates\u202ffor\u202ftwo Michigan counties (Livingston and Washtenaw) were higher than expected in the January 19, 2023 weekly release.\n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b> Due to a backlog of historic COVID-19 cases being reported this week, aggregate case and death counts in Charlotte County and Sarasota County, Florida, will appear higher than expected in the January 26, 2023 weekly release.\n\n<b>January 26, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Mississippi\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0 in the weekly release posted on January 26, 2023.\n\n<b>February 2, 2023:</b> As of the data collection deadline, CDC observed an abnormally large increase in aggregate COVID-19 cases and deaths reported for Washington State. In response, totals for new cases and new deaths released on February 2, 2023, have been displayed as zero at the state level until the issue is addressed with state officials. CDC is working with state officials to address the issue.\n\n<b>February 2, 2023:</b> Due to a decrease reported in cumulative case counts by Wyoming, case rates will be reported as 0 in the February 2, 2023, weekly release. CDC is working with state officials to verify the data submitted.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 16, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Utah\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0 in the weekly release posted on February 16, 2023. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected and should be interpreted with caution.\u00a0\n\n<b>February 16, 2023:</b> Due to a reporting cadence change, Maine\u2019s aggregate case data may contain less than the customary 7 days\u2019 worth of data in the February 16, 2023, release.\n\n<b>February 23, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Hawaii\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected in the February 23, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>March 9, 2023:</b> Due to data processing delays, Utah's aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected in the March 9, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>March 9, 2023:</b> Due to technical difficulties, Washington State's aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected in the March 9, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>March 9, 2023:</b> Due to technical difficulties, Florida's aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0. As a result, case and death metrics will appear lower than expected in the March 9, 2023, weekly release.\n\n<b>March 16, 2023:</b> In coordination with Florida health officials, CDC completed a historical correction to address a technical issue affecting aggregate COVID-19 cases reported by Florida between November 2022 and March 2023.\n\n<b>March 16, 2023:</b> Due to technical difficulties, Arkansas\u2019s aggregate case and death data will be reported as 0.

These data are being presented publicly for the first time this season; further evaluations of these data are underway.\n\n- The pharmacy data include flu vaccinations that were billed for (i.e. claims) or paid by cash. Medical office data are claims based.\n\n- The sampled pharmacies and physician medical offices and the captured volume of transactions represent approximately 92% and 82% of influenza vaccines administered nationally, respectively.\n\n- Vaccinations administered in other settings such as workplaces and community settings are not included in these data.\n\n- Weekly Number of Influenza Vaccinations Administered, in Pharmacies and Physician Medical Offices, Adults 18 years and older, United States, Data Source(s): IQVIA Pharmacy and Physician Medical Office Claims.",

      "description": "Approximately 600 public health and clinical laboratories located throughout the United States, participate in surveillance for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through CDC's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The dataset contains a weekly summary of the total RSV tests and RSV detections reported to NREVSS. These data are reported on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed two years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.\n\nData are collected from collaborating university and community hospital laboratories, select states and county public health laboratories, and commercial laboratories. This information is submitted and updated on a weekly basis. \n\nWhile NREVSS strives to present the most precise national, regional and state respiratory viral trends with the least amount of burden possible for participating laboratories, there are a number of inherent limitations to this surveillance system. \n\nNREVSS does not collect patient-data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested nor does it reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to a particular virus. \n\nParticipating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.\n\n\nFor more information on RSV surveillance and research please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss and https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html",

This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Data collection began on April 23, 2020. Beginning in Phase 3.5 (on June 1, 2022), NCHS included questions about the presence of symptoms of COVID that lasted three months or longer. Phase 3.5 will continue with a two-weeks on, two-weeks off collection and dissemination approach. \n\nEstimates on this page are derived from the Household Pulse Survey and show the percentage of adults aged 18 and over who a) as a proportion of the U.S. population, the percentage of adults who EVER experienced post-COVID conditions (long COVID). These adults had COVID and had some symptoms that lasted three months or longer; b) as a proportion of adults who said they ever had COVID, the percentage who EVER experienced post-COVID conditions; c) as a proportion of the U.S. population, the percentage of adults who are CURRENTLY experiencing post-COVID conditions. These adults had COVID, had long-term symptoms, and are still experiencing symptoms; d) as a proportion of adults who said they ever had COVID, the percentage who are CURRENTLY experiencing post-COVID conditions; and e) as a proportion of the U.S. population, the percentage of adults who said they ever had COVID.",

      "Homepage": null,
      "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions. Data on cases among people who received additional or booster doses were reported from 31 jurisdictions; 30 jurisdictions also reported data on deaths among people who received one or more additional or booster dose; 28 jurisdictions reported cases among people who received two or more additional or booster doses; and 26 jurisdictions reported deaths among people who received two or more additional or booster doses. This list will be updated as more jurisdictions participate.\nIncidence rate estimates: Weekly age-specific incidence rates by vaccination status were calculated as the number of cases or deaths divided by the number of people vaccinated with a primary series, overall or with/without a booster dose (cumulative) or unvaccinated (obtained by subtracting the cumulative number of people vaccinated with a primary series and partially vaccinated people from the 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates) and multiplied by 100,000. Overall incidence rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. To estimate population counts for ages 6 months through 1 year, half of the single-year population counts for ages 0 through 1 year were used. All rates are plotted by positive specimen collection date to reflect when incident infections occurred. For the primary series analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 12 years and older from April 4, 2021 through December 4, 2021, ages 5 years and older from December 5, 2021 through July 30, 2022 and ages 6 months and older from July 31, 2022 onwards. For the booster dose analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 18 years and older from September 19, 2021 through December 25, 2021, ages 12 years and older from December 26, 2021, and ages 5 years and older from June 5, 2022 onwards. Small numbers could contribute to less precision when calculating death rates among some groups.\nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs): IRRs for the past one month were calculated by dividing the average weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by that among people vaccinated with a primary series either overall or with a booster dose.\nPublications: Scobie HM, Johnson AG, Suthar AB, et al.

The RESP-NET platforms have overlapping surveillance areas and use similar methods to collect data. Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. RSV-NET is CDC\u2019s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with RSV. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area.\n\nData are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available.

      "description": "Reporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d. No change was made to the data points previous released.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> New column, \u201chealth_service_area_population\u201d, was added to the dataset to denote the total population in the designated Health Service Area based on 2019 Census estimate. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> FIPS codes for territories American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands were re-formatted to 5-digit numeric for records released on 3/3/2022 to be consistent with other records in the dataset.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Changes were made to the text fields in variables \u201ccounty\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d so the formats are consistent across releases.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> The \u201c%\u201d sign was removed from the text field in column \u201ccovid_inpatient_bed_utilization\u201d. No change was made to the data. As indicated in the column description, values in this column represent the percentage of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (7-day average).  \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Data values for columns, \u201ccounty_population\u201d, \u201chealth_service_area_number\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d were backfilled for records released on 2/24/2022. These columns were added since the week of 3/3/2022, thus the values were previously missing for records released the week prior.\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> Updates made to data released on 3/24/2022 for Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands to correct a data mapping error.\n\n<b>April 21, 2022:</b> COVID-19 Community Level (CCL) data released for counties in Nebraska for the week of April 21, 2022 have 3 counties identified in the high category and 37 in the medium category. CDC has been working with state officials to verify the data submitted, as other data systems are not providing alerts for substantial increases in disease transmission or severity in the state. \n\n<b>May 26, 2022:</b> COVID-19 Community Level (CCL) data released for McCracken County, KY for the week of May 5, 2022 have been updated to correct a data processing error. McCracken County, KY should have appeared in the low community level category during the week of May 5, 2022.

      "description": "The Overview of Health Disparities analysis is a component of the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) Final Review. The analysis included 611 objectives in HP2020. See Technical Notes for the Healthy People 2020 Overview of Health Disparities (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2020/health-disparities.htm) for additional information and criteria for objectives, data years, and population characteristics included in the analysis and statistical formulas and definitions for the disparities measures. \n\nThis file contains estimates and standard errors for the baseline and final years for individual population groups used in the Overview of Health Disparities analysis. The number and definitions of population groups varied across the HP2020 objectives and data sources used. These population groups are shown in the disparities file as originally reported by the data source, rather than the harmonized categories that were used for the HP2020 Progress by Population Group analysis (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2020/population-groups.htm). Additionally, for any given objective, the baseline and final years used for the disparities analysis do not necessarily correspond to the baseline and final years used to evaluate progress toward target attainment in the HP2020 Final Review Progress Table (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2020/progress-tables.htm) and Progress by Population Group analysis (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2020/population-groups.htm). These distinctions should be considered when merging the downloadable Progress Table or Progress by Population Group data files with the Overview of Health Disparities data files, or when integrative analyses that incorporate both disparities and progress data are conducted.  \n    \nData for additional years during the HP2020 tracking period that are not included in the Overview of Health Disparities are available on the HP2020 website (https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/).",

      "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions. Data on cases among people who received additional or booster doses were reported from 31 jurisdictions; 30 jurisdictions also reported data on deaths among people who received one or more additional or booster dose; 28 jurisdictions reported cases among people who received two or more additional or booster doses; and 26 jurisdictions reported deaths among people who received two or more additional or booster doses. This list will be updated as more jurisdictions participate.\nIncidence rate estimates: Weekly age-specific incidence rates by vaccination status were calculated as the number of cases or deaths divided by the number of people vaccinated with a primary series, overall or with/without a booster dose (cumulative) or unvaccinated (obtained by subtracting the cumulative number of people vaccinated with a primary series and partially vaccinated people from the 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates) and multiplied by 100,000. Overall incidence rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. To estimate population counts for ages 6 months through 1 year, half of the single-year population counts for ages 0 through 1 year were used. All rates are plotted by positive specimen collection date to reflect when incident infections occurred. For the primary series analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 12 years and older from April 4, 2021 through December 4, 2021, ages 5 years and older from December 5, 2021 through July 30, 2022 and ages 6 months and older from July 31, 2022 onwards. For the booster dose analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 18 years and older from September 19, 2021 through December 25, 2021, ages 12 years and older from December 26, 2021, and ages 5 years and older from June 5, 2022 onwards. Small numbers could contribute to less precision when calculating death rates among some groups.\nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs): IRRs for the past one month were calculated by dividing the average weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by that among people vaccinated with a primary series either overall or with a booster dose.\nPublications: Scobie HM, Johnson AG, Suthar AB, et al.

The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act or PPPHCEA (P.L. 116-139) appropriated an additional $75 billion for relief funds, and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act appropriated an additional $3 billion.  HRSA established the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to administer payments to eligible providers. A portion of the PRF funds are being used to provide reimbursement to providers for administering Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID-19 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines under a Biologics License Application (BLA) to underinsured individuals. To learn more about the program, visit: https://www.hrsa.gov/covid19-coverage-assistance\n\nThis dataset represents the list of health care entities who have agreed to the Terms and Conditions and received claims reimbursement for costs associated with administering COVID-19 vaccines to underinsured individuals.\n\nFor Provider Relief Fund Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/HHS-Provider-Relief-Fund/kh8y-3es6",

      "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions. Data on cases among people who received additional or booster doses were reported from 31 jurisdictions; 30 jurisdictions also reported data on deaths among people who received one or more additional or booster dose; 28 jurisdictions reported cases among people who received two or more additional or booster doses; and 26 jurisdictions reported deaths among people who received two or more additional or booster doses. This list will be updated as more jurisdictions participate. \nIncidence rate estimates: Weekly age-specific incidence rates by vaccination status were calculated as the number of cases or deaths divided by the number of people vaccinated with a primary series, overall or with/without a booster dose (cumulative) or unvaccinated (obtained by subtracting the cumulative number of people vaccinated with a primary series and partially vaccinated people from the 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates) and multiplied by 100,000. Overall incidence rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census standard population. To estimate population counts for ages 6 months through 1 year, half of the single-year population counts for ages 0 through 1 year were used. All rates are plotted by positive specimen collection date to reflect when incident infections occurred. For the primary series analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 12 years and older from April 4, 2021 through December 4, 2021, ages 5 years and older from December 5, 2021 through July 30, 2022 and ages 6 months and older from July 31, 2022 onwards. For the booster dose analysis, age-standardized rates include ages 18 years and older from September 19, 2021 through December 25, 2021,  ages 12 years and older from December 26, 2021, and ages 5 years and older from June 5, 2022 onwards. Small numbers could contribute to less precision when calculating death rates among some groups.\nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.\nIncidence rate ratios (IRRs): IRRs for the past one month were calculated by dividing the average weekly incidence rates among unvaccinated people by that among people vaccinated with a primary series either overall or with a booster dose.\nPublications: Scobie HM, Johnson AG, Suthar AB, et al.

As part of NAMCS, the Physician Induction Interview collects information about practice characteristics at physician offices. Partway through the 2020 NAMCS, NCHS added questions to the Physician Induction Interview to assess physician experiences related to COVID-19 in office-based settings.\n\nThe data include nationally representative estimates of experiences related to COVID-19 among office-based physicians in the United States, including: shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the past 3 months; the ability to test for COVID-19 in the past 3 months; providers testing positive for COVID-19 in the past 3 months; turning away COVID-19 patients in the past 3 months; and telemedicine or telehealth technology use before and after March 2020.  Estimates were derived from interviews with physicians in periods 3 and 4 of 2020 NAMCS and periods 1 through 4 of 2021 NAMCS, which occurred between December 15, 2020 and May 6, 2022.  The data are considered preliminary, and the results may change with the final data release.",

      "Homepage": "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/prov-county-drug-overdose.htm",
      "description": "This data visualization presents county-level provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. County-level provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts (see Technical Notes).\n\nThe provisional data presented on the dashboard below include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of death due to drug overdose by the decedent\u2019s county of residence and the month in which death occurred.\n\nPercentages of deaths with a cause of death pending further investigation and a note on historical completeness (e.g. if the percent completeness was under 90% after 6 months) are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical Notes). Counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nNature and Sources of Data\n\nProvisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from the state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\n\nThe timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death and jurisdiction in which the death occurred. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death due to the time often needed to investigate these deaths (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.\n\nProvisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12 month-ending periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12 month-ending period in June 2020 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The 12 month-ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12 month-ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.\n\nCause of Death Classification and Definition of Drug Deaths\n\nMortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented on this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2). Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310): X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined).\n\nSelection of Specific Jurisdictions to Report\n\nProvisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction where the decedent resides (e.g. county of residence). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented, along with measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, and a note for specific jurisdictions with historically lower levels of data completeness (where provisional 2019 data were less than 90% complete after 6 months).\n\nPercentage of Records Pending Investigation\n\nDrug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. Counts of drug overdose deaths may be underestimated to a greater extent in jurisdictions or counties where more records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d for the six most recent 12 month-ending periods.\n\nHistorical Completeness\n\nThe historical percent completeness of provisional data is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction and county after a 6-month lag for deaths occurring in 2019 by the number of deaths eventually included in the final data files. Counties with historically lower levels of provisional data completeness are flagged with a note to indicate that the data may be incomplete in these areas. However, the completeness of provisional data may change over time, and therefore the degree of underestimation will not be known until data are finalized (typically 11-12 months after the end of the data year).\n\nDifferences between Final and Provisional Data\n\nThere may be differences between provisional and final data for a given data year (e.g., 2020). Final drug overdose death data published annually through NCHS statistical reports (3) and CDC WONDER undergo additional data quality checks and processing. Provisional counts reported here are subject to change as additional data are received.\n\nSource\n\nNCHS, National Vital Statistics System. Estimates for 2020 and 2021 are based on provisional data.

      "description": "This dataset contains model-based ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release in GIS-friendly format. The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2010 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the ZCTA level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8eca985039464f4d83467b8f6aeb1320 for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.",

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates  include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The term \u201ccombined seroprevalence\u201d refers to the combined infection- and vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences. This is the population that has  anti-S antibodies, regardless of the presence of anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey. It offers an interactive visualization available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence\n\nAdditional information is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/blood-bank-serosurvey.html",

De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Infection-induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and refers to the prevalence of the population with both anti-S and anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey. It offers an interactive visualization available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence\n\nAdditional information is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/blood-bank-serosurvey.html",

      "description": "[1] The Progress by Population Group analysis is a component of the Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) Final Review. The analysis included subsets of the 1,111 measurable HP2020 objectives that have data available for any of six broad population characteristics: sex, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, family income, disability status, and geographic location. Progress toward meeting HP2020 targets is presented for up to 24 population groups within these characteristics, based on objective data aggregated across HP2020 topic areas. The Progress by Population Group data are also available at the individual objective level in the downloadable data set. \n[2] The final value was generally based on data available on the HP2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into HP2030, more recent data will be included on the HP2030 website as it becomes available: https://health.gov/healthypeople.\n[3] For more information on the HP2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt27.pdf.\n[4] Status for objectives included in the HP2020 Progress by Population Group analysis was determined using the baseline, final, and target value. The progress status categories used in HP2020 were:\n\na. Target met or exceeded\u2014One of the following applies: (i) At baseline, the target was not met or exceeded, and the most recent value was equal to or exceeded the target (the percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target (the percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed). \n\nb. Improved\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.\n\nc. Little or no detectable change\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.\n\nd. Got worse\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.\n\nNOTE: Measurable objectives had baseline data.\nSOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, Healthy People 2020 Progress by Population Group database.",

Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original dataset</a> with daily data as posted is archived on 10/20/2022.

A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days\u2019 data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf the two metrics suggest different transmission levels, the higher level is selected. If one metric is missing, the other metric is used for the indicator.\n\nThe reported transmission categories include:\n\nLow Transmission Threshold: Counties with fewer than 10 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, and a NAAT percent test positivity in the past 7 days below 5%;\n\nModerate Transmission Threshold: Counties with 10-49 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 5.0-7.99%;\n\nSubstantial Transmission Threshold: Counties with 50-99 total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 8.0-9.99%;\n\nHigh Transmission Threshold: Counties with 100 or more total cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days or a NAAT test percent positivity in the past 7 days of 10.0% or greater.\n\nBlank: total new cases in the past 7 days are not reported (county data known to be unavailable) and the percentage of positive NAATs tests during the past 7 days (blank) are not reported.\n\n<b>Data Suppression</b>\nTo prevent the release of data that could be used to identify people, data cells are suppressed for low frequency. When the <b>case counts</b> used to calculate the total new case rate metric (\"cases_per_100K_7_day_count_change\") is greater than zero and less than 10, this metric is set to \"suppressed\" to protect individual privacy. If the case count is 0, the total new case rate metric is still displayed.\n\nThe data in this dataset are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers. This datasets are created using <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">CDC\u2019s Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a>.\n\n<b>Duplicate Records Issue</b>\nA bug was found on 12/28/2021 that caused many records in the dataset to be duplicated.

BCPP was a community randomized trial that examined the impact of prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 15 intervention and 15 control communities. The interventions included extensive HIV testing, linkage to care, and universal treatment services. To reduce HIV incidence in the intervention communities, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals were used: 90% of HIV-positive persons know their status; 90% of persons who know status are to be on ART; 90% of persons on ART are to be virally suppressed. The BCPP study is composed of 2 interlocking protocols: Evaluation Protocol and Intervention Protocol. The Evaluation Protocol of the BCPP evaluated the primary endpoint (HIV incidence), as well as some key related secondary endpoints. This protocol focused on the Baseline Household Survey; the HIV Incidence Cohort; and an End of Study Survey. The Intervention Protocol of the BCPP implemented the combination prevention (CP) intervention package in CPCs and measures the uptake of these interventions (expanded HIV testing and counselling, strengthened male circumcision, and expanded HIV Care and Treatment).",

CDC's national genomic surveillance system collects SARS-CoV-2 specimens for sequencing through the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program, as well as SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated by commercial or academic laboratories contracted by CDC and state or local public health laboratories. Viral genomic sequences are analyzed and classified as a particular variant. The proportions of variants in a population are estimated nationally, by HHS region, and by jurisdiction. The thousands of sequences analyzed every week through CDC\u2019s national genomic sequencing and bioinformatics efforts fuel this comprehensive and population-based U.S. surveillance system established to identify and monitor the spread of variants.\n\nThese data appear on the CDC COVID Data Tracker at the following URL: <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions\">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions</a>\n\n\nFor more information on how these data are generated and used to provide estimates of variant proportions, please see the following references:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Paul P, France AM, Aoki Y, et al.

      "description": "To rapidly monitor recent changes in the use of telemedicine, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB) partnered with the Census Bureau on an experimental data system called the Household Pulse Survey. This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.",

PUMAs can consist of part of a single densely populated county or can combine parts or all of multiple counties that are less densely populated.\n\nThe HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents\u2019 intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period May 26, 2021 \u2013 June 7, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 31.\n\n\nCounty and State Hesitancy Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw",

      "description": "Due to the change in the survey instrument regarding intention to vaccinate, our estimates for \u201chesitant or unsure\u201d or \u201chesitant\u201d derived from April 14-26, 2021, are not directly comparable with prior Household Pulse Survey data and should not be used to examine trends in hesitancy.\n\nTo support state and local communication and outreach efforts, ASPE developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates (https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) using the most recently available federal survey data.\n\nWe estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey (HPS) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) data and utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates at the Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) level using the Census Bureau\u2019s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html). To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center(https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2014.html). PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations.\n\nThe HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents\u2019 intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period May 26, 2021 \u2013 June 7, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 31..\n\nPUMA COVID-19 Hesitancy Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-Public-Use-Microdat/djj9-kh3p",

      "description": "VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates\n2017, 2019, 2021, 2022. This dataset contains estimates of the prevalence of visual acuity loss and major eye diseases generated using a Bayesian meta-analytic modeling approach that combines information from multiple data sources to produce comprehensive estimates of prevalence by age, race, and gender at the national, state and county levels. These composite prevalence estimates are the primary surveillance measures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).  \n\nFor more information about these estimates including summary tables and maps, methods, and links to related publications visit https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/index.html\nTo view this data in the VEHSS interactive data visualization application, visit https://ddt-vehss.cdc.gov/ and search for \u201cVEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimate\u201d.\n\n\nVisual Acuity Loss:\nVisual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Measured Visual Acuity\u2019.  Rows with Subgroup = \u2018Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.\n\n\nAge Related Macular Degeneration:\nThe age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = \u2018Age Related Macular Degeneration\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen \u2265125 \u00b5m in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.\n\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy:\nThe diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Diabetic Eye Diseases\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening DR\u2019 includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening DR\u2019 is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.\n\n\nGlaucoma:\nThe glaucoma estimates represent glaucoma as measured with retinal imaging examination and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Glaucoma\u2019. The Subgroup \u2018Vision affecting glaucoma\u2019 includes people with glaucoma and abnormal visual field. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision affecting glaucoma\u2019 is defined as people with glaucoma without an abnormal visual field.\n\n\nAge Groups:\nThe VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text \u201cby detailed age groups\u201d in the \u2018Indicator\u2019 field. \n\n\nPrevalence Data Type:\nThese estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = \u2018Crude Prevalence\u2019) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=\u2019Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.\n\n  \nData Sources:\nData sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claims, the Health Resources & Service Administration\u2019s Area Resources File, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS), the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG), the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES), the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Cohort (MESA), Diabetic Retinopathy Inpatient Study (DRIPS), Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents & Youth (TODAY), and other studies.",

      "description": "This dataset provides model-based provisional estimates of the weekly numbers of drug overdose, suicide, and transportation-related deaths using \u201cnowcasting\u201d methods to account for the normal lag between the occurrence and reporting of these deaths. Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11\u201312 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

      "description": "<b>Note:</b>\nReporting of new COVID-19 Case Surveillance data will be discontinued July 1, 2024, to align with the process of removing SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19 cases) from the list of nationally notifiable diseases. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, the dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nAuthorizations to collect certain public health data expired at the end of the U.S. public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023. The following jurisdictions discontinued COVID-19 case notifications to CDC: Iowa (11/8/21), Kansas (5/12/23), Kentucky (1/1/24), Louisiana (10/31/23), New Hampshire (5/23/23), and Oklahoma (5/2/23). Please note that these jurisdictions will not routinely send new case data after the dates indicated. As of 7/13/23, case notifications from Oregon will only include pediatric cases resulting in death.\n\n\nThis case surveillance public use dataset has 19 elements for all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and includes demographics, geography (county and state of residence), any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, and presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors.\n\nCurrently, CDC provides the public with three versions of COVID-19 case surveillance line-listed data: this <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4\">19 data element dataset with geography</a>, a <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf\">12 data element public use dataset</a>, and a <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t\">33 data element restricted access dataset</a>.\n\nThe following apply to the public use datasets and the restricted access dataset:\n<ul><li>Data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf.</li><li>Data are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers.</li><li>Some data are suppressed to protect individual privacy.</li><li>Datasets will include all cases with the earliest date available in each record (date received by CDC or date related to illness/specimen collection) at least 14 days prior to the creation of the current datasets. This 14-day lag allows case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data are accurately captured.</li><li>Datasets are updated monthly.</li><li>Datasets are created using CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html\">Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a> and include protections designed to protect individual privacy.</li><li>For more information about data collection and reporting, please see\u202f<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.</a></li><li>For more information about the COVID-19 case surveillance data, please see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\"> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html</a><br></li></ul>\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\nThe COVID-19 case surveillance database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\">Nationally Notifiable Condition List</a> and classified as \u201cimmediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\u201d by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020, to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and reported voluntarily to CDC.\n\nFor more information: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\n<b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b>\nCOVID-19 case reports are routinely submitted to CDC by public health jurisdictions using nationally standardized case reporting forms. On April 5, 2020, CSTE released an Interim Position Statement with national surveillance case definitions for COVID-19. Current versions of these case definitions are available at: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/. All cases reported on or after were requested to be shared by public health departments to CDC using the standardized case definitions for lab-confirmed or probable cases. On May 5, 2020, the standardized case reporting form was revised. States and territories continue to use this form.\n\n<h4><b>Data are Considered Provisional</b></h4>\n<ul><li>The COVID-19 case surveillance data are dynamic; case reports can be modified at any time by the jurisdictions sharing COVID-19 data with CDC. CDC may update prior cases shared with CDC based on any updated information from jurisdictions. For instance, as new information is gathered about previously reported cases, health departments provide updated data to CDC. As more information and data become available, analyses might find changes in surveillance data and trends during a previously reported time window. Data may also be shared late with CDC due to the volume of COVID-19 cases.</li><li>Annual finalized data: To create the final NNDSS data used in the annual tables, CDC works carefully with the reporting jurisdictions to reconcile the data received during the year until each state or territorial epidemiologist confirms that the data from their area are correct.</li></ul>\n\nAccess <a href=\"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RaceEthnicityData_FINAL.pdf\">Addressing Gaps in Public Health Reporting of Race and Ethnicity for COVID-19</a>, a report from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, to better understand the challenges in completing race and ethnicity data for COVID-19 and recommendations for improvement.\n\n<h3><b>Data Limitations</b></h3>\nTo learn more about the limitations in using case surveillance data, visit <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<h4><b>Data Quality Assurance Procedures</b></h4>\nCDC\u2019s Case Surveillance Section routinely performs data quality assurance procedures (i.e., ongoing corrections and logic checks to address data errors). To date, the following data cleaning steps have been implemented:\n<ul><li>Questions that have been left unanswered (blank) on the case report form are reclassified to a Missing value, if applicable to the question. For example, in the question \"Was the individual hospitalized?\" where the possible answer choices include \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Unknown,\" the blank value is recoded to \"Missing\" because the case report form did not include a response to the question.</li><li>Logic checks are performed for date data. If an illogical date has been provided, CDC reviews the data with the reporting jurisdiction. For example, if a symptom onset date in the future is reported to CDC, this value is set to null until the reporting jurisdiction updates the date appropriately.</li><li>Additional data quality processing to recode free text data is ongoing. Data on symptoms, race, ethnicity, and healthcare worker status have been prioritized.</li></ul>\n\n<h4><b>Data Suppression</b></h4>\nTo prevent release of data that could be used to identify people, data cells are suppressed for low frequency (<11 COVID-19 case records with a given values). Suppression includes low frequency combinations of case month, geographic characteristics (county and state of residence), and demographic characteristics (sex, age group, race, and ethnicity). Suppressed values are re-coded to the NA answer option; records with data suppression are never removed.\n\n<h4><b>Additional COVID-19 Data</b></h4>\nCOVID-19 data are available to the public as summary or aggregate count files, including total counts of cases and deaths by state and by county. These and other COVID-19 data are available from multiple public locations: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/\">COVID Data Tracker</a>; <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/Weekly-United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-/pwn4-m3yp\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/index.html\">COVID-19 Vaccination Reporting Data Systems</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">COVID-19 Death Data and Resources</a>.\n\n<b>Notes:</b>\n\n<b>March 1, 2022:</b> The \"COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data with Geography\" will be updated on a monthly basis.\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data.  An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassifying deaths that were not COVID-19 related. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date.\n\n<b>June 25, 2024:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data. An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassification of pediatric deaths from New York State. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date for New York State.\n\n<b>June 26, 2024:</b> Reported COVID-19 cases resulting in death of Texas residents should be interpreted with caution. In November 2023, CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) identified an unresolved issue in the demographics of COVID-19 patient case deaths as reported to CDC by Texas DSHS. As a result, Texas case deaths reported to COVID-19 line level case notification data are disproportionate compared with reporting by Texas DSHS and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Because of this issue, an adjustment could not be implemented to correct the misclassifications. However, provisional COVID-19 death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated with information from death certificates and offers accurate death counts.\u201d",

(The percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed.) \n\n2 - Improved\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.\n\n3 - Little or no detectable change\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.\n\n4 - Got worse\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.\n\n5 - Baseline only\u2014The objective only had one data point, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed. Note that if additional data points did not meet the criteria for statistical reliability, data quality, or confidentiality, the objective was categorized as baseline only. \n\n6 - Informational\u2014A target was not set for this objective, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed.\n\n\n[2] The final value is generally based on data available on the Healthy People 2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. \n\n\n[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): \n\nPercentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100\n\n\n[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: \n\nMagnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100\n\n\n[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test. \n\n\n[6] For more information on the Healthy People 2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt27.pdf.\n\nNOTE: Measurable objectives have baseline data.\nSOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, Healthy People 2020 database.",

This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund (PRF) money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\n\nThe Department allocated $50 billion in PRF payments for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. HHS has made other PRF distributions to a wide array of health care providers and more information on those distributions can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/data/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external\">https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/data/index.html</a>",

      "description": "Weekly Cumulative Estimated Number of Influenza Vaccinations Administered in Pharmacies and Physician Medical Offices, Adults 18 years and older, United States\n\n- Archived data are here:  https://data.cdc.gov/resource/uxgd-cqqc\n\n- CDC is exploring use of data obtained from IQVIA\u00a7 (https://www.iqvia.com/) as a source of information on vaccinations administered in retail pharmacies (include chain, mass merchandise, food stores, and independent pharmacies) and physician medical offices.  \n \n- These projected pharmacy estimates include flu vaccinations that were billed for (i.e. claims) or paid by cash. Medical office projected estimates are claims-based only. \n \n- The sampled pharmacies and physician medical offices and the captured volume of transactions represent approximately 92% and 82% of influenza vaccines administered nationally, respectively. \n \n- Vaccinations administered in other settings such as workplaces and community settings are not included in these data. \n \n\n*National estimates for pharmacies and medical offices include vaccinations administered in 50 states and DC. National estimates for medical office vaccinations do not include doses where geographic information (i.e. which state the dose was administered in) was missing. Pharmacy data are through Friday of each week and medical office data are through Saturday of each week. Week ending dates for prior seasons are aligned with the current season\u2019s week ending dates. \n\n\u00a7 1) King, L. M., Bartoces, M., Fleming-Dutra, K. E., et. al, L. A. (2020).

Additionally, the NHCS contributes data that may inform public health emergencies as the survey is designed to capture emerging diseases and viruses that require hospitalizations, including COVID-19 encounters. The 2020 - 2023 NHCS are not yet fully operational so it is important to note that these data are not nationally representative.\n\nThe data are from 26 hospitals submitting inpatient and 26 hospitals submitting ED Uniform Bill (UB)-04 administrative claims from March 18, 2020-December 26, 2023.  Even though the data are not nationally representative, they can provide insight on the impact of COVID-19 on various types of hospitals throughout the country. This information is not available in other hospital reporting systems. The NHCS data from these hospitals can show results by a combination of indicators related to COVID-19, such as length of inpatient stay, in-hospital mortality, comorbidities, and intubation or ventilator use.

On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\">Nationally Notifiable Condition List</a> and classified as \u201cimmediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\u201d by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020, to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and reported voluntarily to CDC.\n\nCOVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and are shared voluntarily with CDC. For more information, visit:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/about-us-cases-deaths.html.\n\nThe deidentified data in the restricted access dataset include demographic characteristics, state and county of residence, any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities.\n\nAll data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf.\n\nCOVID-19 case reports have been routinely submitted using standardized case reporting forms.\n\nOn April 5, 2020, CSTE released an Interim Position Statement with national surveillance case definitions for COVID-19 included. Current versions of these case definitions are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/.\n\nCSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020, to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. All cases reported on or after were requested to be shared by public health departments to CDC using the standardized case definitions for lab-confirmed or probable cases.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the standardized case reporting form was revised. Case reporting using this new form is ongoing among U.S. states and territories.\n\n<h4><b>Data are Considered Provisional</b></h4>\n<ul><li>The COVID-19 case surveillance data are dynamic; case reports can be modified at any time by the jurisdictions sharing COVID-19 data with CDC. CDC may update prior cases shared with CDC based on any updated information from jurisdictions. For instance, as new information is gathered about previously reported cases, health departments provide updated data to CDC. As more information and data become available, analyses might find changes in surveillance data and trends during a previously reported time window. Data may also be shared late with CDC due to the volume of COVID-19 cases.</li><li>Annual finalized data: To create the final NNDSS data used in the annual tables, CDC works carefully with the reporting jurisdictions to reconcile the data received during the year until each state or territorial epidemiologist confirms that the data from their area are correct.</li></ul>\n\nAccess <a href=\"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RaceEthnicityData_FINAL.pdf\">Addressing Gaps in Public Health Reporting of Race and Ethnicity for COVID-19</a>, a report from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, to better understand the challenges in completing race and ethnicity data for COVID-19 and recommendations for improvement.\n\n<h3><b>Data Limitations</b></h3>\nTo learn more about the limitations in using case surveillance data, visit <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<h4><b>Data Quality Assurance Procedures</b></h4>\nCDC\u2019s Case Surveillance Section routinely performs data quality assurance procedures (i.e., ongoing corrections and logic checks to address data errors). To date, the following data cleaning steps have been implemented:\n<ul><li>Questions that have been left unanswered (blank) on the case report form are reclassified to a Missing value, if applicable to the question. For example, in the question \"Was the individual hospitalized?\" where the possible answer choices include \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Unknown,\" the blank value is recoded to \"Missing\" because the case report form did not include a response to the question.</li><li>Logic checks are performed for date data. If an illogical date has been provided, CDC reviews the data with the reporting jurisdiction. For example, if a symptom onset date in the future is reported to CDC, this value is set to null until the reporting jurisdiction updates the date appropriately.</li><li>Additional data quality processing to recode free text data is ongoing. Data on symptoms, race, ethnicity, and healthcare worker status have been prioritized.</li></ul>\n\n<h4><b>Data Suppression</b></h4>\nTo prevent release of data that could be used to identify people, data cells are suppressed for low frequency (<11 COVID-19 case records with a given values). Suppression includes low frequency combinations of case month, geographic characteristics (county and state of residence), and demographic characteristics (sex, age group, race, and ethnicity). Suppressed values are re-coded to the NA answer option; records with data suppression are never removed.\n\n<h4><b>Additional COVID-19 Data</b></h4>\nCOVID-19 data are available to the public as summary or aggregate count files, including total counts of cases and deaths by state and by county. These and other COVID-19 data are available from multiple public locations: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/\">COVID Data Tracker</a>; <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/Weekly-United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-/pwn4-m3yp\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/index.html\">COVID-19 Vaccination Reporting Data Systems</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">COVID-19 Death Data and Resources</a>.\n\n<b>Notes:</b>\n\n<b>March 1, 2022:</b> The \"COVID-19 Case Surveillance Restricted Access Detailed Data\" will be updated on a monthly basis. <br>\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data.  An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassifying deaths that were not COVID-19 related. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date. <br>\n\n<b>June 9, 2022:</b> Two new data elements, \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d, were added to the dataset to provide information on race and Hispanic origin, respectively. These two new elements were to replace the column \u201crace_ethnicity_combined\u201d that encoded the combined race and Hispanic origin information in previous versions. Codes and related details used for these two new elements are available at: <a href=\u201chttps://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mbd7-r32t/files/4697b7f1-c0ea-403a-9583-6a02fd33a21c?download=true&filename=data_dictionary_covid_cases_restricted_detailed_updated.xlsx\u201d>Data Dictionary for the COVID-19 Case Surveillance Restricted Access Detailed Data</a>. Conversion logic is also provided in the data dictionary for users to derive a combined race and Hispanic origin item similar to the item \u201crace_ethnicity_combined\u201d in previous release, using the current \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d variables.  <br>\n\n<b>June 25, 2024:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data. An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassification of pediatric deaths from New York State. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date for New York State.  <br>\n\n<b>June 26, 2024:</b> Reported COVID-19 cases resulting in death of Texas residents should be interpreted with caution. In November 2023, CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) identified an unresolved issue in the demographics of COVID-19 patient case deaths as reported to CDC by Texas DSHS. As a result, Texas case deaths reported to COVID-19 line level case notification data are disproportionate compared with reporting by Texas DSHS and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Because of this issue, an adjustment could not be implemented to correct the misclassifications. However, provisional COVID-19 death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated with information from death certificates and offers accurate death counts.\u201d",

The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the Census tract 2022 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the census tract level.

      "description": "The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.\n\nUpdated on 3/31/2025 to comply with the President\u2019s Executive Order 14168.",

      "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about whether providers offered telemedicine (including video and telephone appointments) in the last 2 months\u2014both during and before the pandemic\u2014and about the use of telemedicine in the last 2 months during the pandemic. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many local and state governments discouraged people from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons. Although health care is considered an essential activity, telemedicine offers an opportunity for care without the potential or perceived risks of leaving the home. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, added telemedicine questions to its sample adult questionnaire in July 2020.  The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/telemedicine-use.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of telemedicine use during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 3.1, which started on April 14, 2021). The Household Pulse Survey reports telemedicine use in the last 4 weeks among adults and among households with at least one child under age 18 years. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine in the past 2 months, who used telemedicine in the past 2 months, or who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine prior to the coronavirus pandemic.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2022 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

Data consists exclusively of state and territorial orders, many of which apply to specific counties within their respective state or territory; therefore, data is broken down to the county level. \n\nThese data are derived from publicly available state and territorial executive orders, administrative orders, resolutions, and proclamations (\u201corders\u201d) for COVID-19 that expressly require individuals to wear masks in public found by the CDC, COVID-19 Community Intervention & Critical Populations Task Force, Monitoring & Evaluation Team, Mitigation Policy Analysis Unit, Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support, Public Health Law Program, and Max Gakh, Assistant Professor, School of Public Health, University of Nevada, Las Vegas from April 10, 2020 through August 15, 2021.  These data will be updated as new orders are collected. Any orders not available through publicly accessible websites are not included in these data. Only official copies of the documents or, where official copies were unavailable, official press releases from government websites describing requirements were coded; news media reports on restrictions were excluded. Recommendations not included in an order are not included in these data. Effective and expiration dates were coded using only the dates provided; no distinction was made based on the specific time of the day the order became effective or expired. These data do not include data on counties that have opted out of their state mask mandate pursuant to state law.

The PPPHCEA appropriated an additional $75 billion in relief funds and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act (P.L. 116-260) appropriated another $3 billion.

Cause of death counts are based on the underlying cause of death, and presented for Respiratory diseases, Circulatory diseases, Malignant neoplasms, and Alzheimer disease and dementia.

      "description": "We are releasing data that compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of May 15, 2020.  This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf. Requests for additional data related to the program must be submitted through the CMS FOIA office. For more information on how to submit a FOIA request please visit our website at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/FOIA. The PRF is administered by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA).

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, the dataset will no longer be updated.  \n\nAuthorizations to collect certain public health data expired at the end of the U.S. public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023. The following jurisdictions discontinued COVID-19 case notifications to CDC: Iowa (11/8/21), Kansas (5/12/23), Kentucky (1/1/24), Louisiana (10/31/23), New Hampshire (5/23/23), and Oklahoma (5/2/23).

On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/\">Nationally Notifiable Condition List</a> and classified as \u201cimmediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)\u201d by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-01</a>). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020, to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification (<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf\">Interim-20-ID-02</a>). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and reported voluntarily to CDC.\n\nFor more information: \n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/action/stories/covid-19-response.html\">NNDSS Supports the COVID-19 Response | CDC</a>.<br>\n\nThe deidentified data in the \u201cCOVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data\u201d include demographic characteristics, any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors. All data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf.\n\n<h4><b>COVID-19 Case Reports</b></h4>\n\nCOVID-19 case reports have been routinely submitted using nationally standardized case reporting forms. On April 5, 2020, CSTE released an Interim Position Statement with national surveillance case definitions for COVID-19 included. Current versions of these case definitions are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/.\n\nAll cases reported on or after were requested to be shared by public health departments to CDC using the standardized case definitions for laboratory-confirmed or probable cases. On May 5, 2020, the standardized case reporting form was revised. Case reporting using this new form is ongoing among U.S. states and territories.\n\n<h4><b>Data are Considered Provisional</b></h4>\n<ul><li>The COVID-19 case surveillance data are dynamic; case reports can be modified at any time by the jurisdictions sharing COVID-19 data with CDC. CDC may update prior cases shared with CDC based on any updated information from jurisdictions. For instance, as new information is gathered about previously reported cases, health departments provide updated data to CDC. As more information and data become available, analyses might find changes in surveillance data and trends during a previously reported time window. Data may also be shared late with CDC due to the volume of COVID-19 cases.</li><li>Annual finalized data: To create the final NNDSS data used in the annual tables, CDC works carefully with the reporting jurisdictions to reconcile the data received during the year until each state or territorial epidemiologist confirms that the data from their area are correct.</li><li>Access <a href=\"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RaceEthnicityData_FINAL.pdf\">Addressing Gaps in Public Health Reporting of Race and Ethnicity for COVID-19</a>, a report from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, to better understand the challenges in completing race and ethnicity data for COVID-19 and recommendations for improvement.</li></ul>\n\n<h3><b>Data Limitations</b></h3>\nTo learn more about the limitations in using case surveillance data, visit <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<h4><b>Data Quality Assurance Procedures</b></h4>\nCDC\u2019s Case Surveillance Section routinely performs data quality assurance procedures (i.e., ongoing corrections and logic checks to address data errors). To date, the following data cleaning steps have been implemented:\n<ul><li>Questions that have been left unanswered (blank) on the case report form are reclassified to a Missing value, if applicable to the question. For example, in the question \u201cWas the individual hospitalized?\u201d where the possible answer choices include \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or \u201cUnknown,\u201d the blank value is recoded to Missing because the case report form did not include a response to the question.</li><li>Logic checks are performed for date data. If an illogical date has been provided, CDC reviews the data with the reporting jurisdiction. For example, if a symptom onset date in the future is reported to CDC, this value is set to null until the reporting jurisdiction updates the date appropriately.</li><li>Additional data quality processing to recode free text data is ongoing. Data on symptoms, race and ethnicity, and healthcare worker status have been prioritized.</li></ul>\n\n<h4><b>Data Suppression</b></h4>\nTo prevent release of data that could be used to identify people, data cells are suppressed for low frequency (<5) records and indirect identifiers (e.g., date of first positive specimen). Suppression includes rare combinations of demographic characteristics (sex, age group, race/ethnicity). Suppressed values are re-coded to the NA answer option; records with data suppression are never removed.\n\n<b>For questions, please contact Ask SRRG (<a href=\"mailto:eocevent394@cdc.gov\">eocevent394@cdc.gov</a>).</b>\n\n<h4><b>Additional COVID-19 Data</b></h4>\nCOVID-19 data are available to the public as summary or aggregate count files, including total counts of cases and deaths by state and by county. These and other COVID-19 data are available from multiple public locations: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/\">COVID Data Tracker</a>; <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/Weekly-United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-/pwn4-m3yp\">United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/index.html\">COVID-19 Vaccination Reporting Data Systems</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">COVID-19 Death Data and Resources</a>.\n\n<b>Notes:</b>\n\n<b>March 1, 2022:</b> The \"COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data\" will be updated on a monthly basis.\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data.  An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassifying deaths that were not COVID-19 related. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date.\n\n<b>June 25, 2024:</b> An adjustment was made to CDC\u2019s cleaning algorithm for COVID-19 line level case notification data. An assumption in CDC's algorithm led to misclassification of pediatric deaths from New York State. The algorithm has since been revised, and this dataset update reflects corrected individual level information about death status for all cases collected to date for New York State.\n\n<b>June 26, 2024:</b> Reported COVID-19 cases resulting in death of Texas residents should be interpreted with caution. In November 2023, CDC and Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) identified an unresolved issue in the demographics of COVID-19 patient case deaths as reported to CDC by Texas DSHS. As a result, Texas case deaths reported to COVID-19 line level case notification data are disproportionate compared with reporting by Texas DSHS and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Because of this issue, an adjustment could not be implemented to correct the misclassifications. However, provisional COVID-19 death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated with information from death certificates and offers accurate death counts.\u201d",

      "description": "Effective September 27, 2023, this dataset will no longer be updated. Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Tuberculosis data for weeks 4-31 are incorrect for New York City; the Middle Atlantic region total; U.S. Residents, excluding U.S. Territories total; and the grand total, due to data processing issues. \nNotice: Tuberculosis data for weeks 32-33 are incorrect for the U.S. Residents, excluding U.S. Territories total and the grand total, due to data processing issues. \n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

      "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2018 release. This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.",

      "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2017 release. This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from VSP, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. VSP claims for VEHSS provides a convenience sample of vision insurance members representing approximately more than 1 in 4 of the U.S. population. VSP uses a web-based claims submissions system to collect and process claims. The denominator of the rates represents persons with VSP benefits as reported by employers, and is subject to some uncertainty.  VSP data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Eye Health Condition indicators.  Certain ophthalmic conditions and procedures are covered by health insurance and are not covered by managed vision insurance, claims based eye disease prevalence may therefore be expected to undercount true prevalence.  Person level claims and person counts are not publically available.  Reported rates were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Detailed information on VEHSS VSP analyses can be found on the VEHSS VSP webpage (link). Information on VSP data can be found on the VSP website (www.vsp.com). The VEHSS VSP dataset was last updated in June 2018.",

Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body.",

      "description": "This data presents provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\n\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm",

      "description": "This data set contains estimated teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) by county and year.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nEstimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15\u201319 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15\u201319) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information\u2014including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables\u2014to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.\nMedian teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15\u201319 for counties in a state.\nBayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.\n\nNOTES\n\nData on the number of live births for women aged 15\u201319 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003\u20132015 (5).\n\nPopulation estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.\n\nHierarchical Bayesian space\u2013time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003\u20132015 (1,2,3,4).\n\nThe Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-\u03b1)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector \u03b8 and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space \u0424 such that\n1-\u03b1\u2264P({C\u2502y})=\u222bp{\u03b8 \u2502y}d\u03b8,\nwhere integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of \u03b8.  The probability that \u03b8 lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- \u03b1) (6).\n\nCounty borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).",

      "description": "NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases - 2018. In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  This tables excludes U.S. territories.\n\nNotice:  The case counts for Haemophilus influenzae, invasive disease Nontypeable\" and \"Non-b serotype\" were switched for 2018 weeks 1-52.\n\nNote:\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistic web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\n\nFootnote:\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA: Not available. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. \n\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  \n\n\u2020 This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. \n\n\u00a7 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\n\n\u00b6 Not reportable in all jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.\n\n** Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.   \n\n\u2020\u2020 Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.  \n\n\u00a7\u00a7 Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2013 have been variant influenza viruses.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 Prior to 2018, cases of paratyphoid fever were included with salmonellosis cases (see Table II). \n\n*** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers'. NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

      "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

      "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2016 release. This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.\nNote: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application. The other obesity estimates (city-level age-adjusted and tract-level) and the Mapbooks were not affected. No other measures were affected. The correct estimates are update in this dataset on October 25, 2017.",

      "description": "MMWR Surveillance Summary 66 (No. SS-1):1-8 found that nonmetropolitan areas have significant numbers of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death. These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.\r\n\r\nUnderlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nHeart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20\u2013I51)\r\nCancer (C00\u2013C97)\r\nUnintentional injury (V01\u2013X59 and Y85\u2013Y86)\r\nChronic lower respiratory disease (J40\u2013J47)\r\nStroke (I60\u2013I69)\r\nLocality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2013 county-based classification scheme.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nUsers can explore three benchmarks:\r\n\r\n\u201c2010 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.\r\n\u201c2005 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.\r\n\u201cFloating\u201d is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.\r\n \r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

Beginning in 2015, NNDSS has been updated to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed below. In addition to the four cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States to date in 2014, six residents of the United States have been medically evacuated to the United States for care after developing Ebola in West Africa. Ten of the 11 VHF cases reported for 2014 are confirmed as Ebola and one as Lassa fever. \r\n\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists approved position statement 16-ID-01 in June 2016, which modifies the previous case definition and naming convention from \"Zika virus congenital infection\" to \"Zika virus disease, non-congenital\u201d.",

      "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2019 release. This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

      "description": "This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

      "description": "ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all \u201cPatients using their own eggs\u201d or for \u201cPatients with no prior ART using their own eggs.\u201d For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent\u2019s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research\u2014that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision.

The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\". Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View additional information for indicator definitions and documentation by selecting Content Area \"Air Quality\" and the respective indicator at the following website: http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action",

      "description": "This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960. More information on historical data on age-adjusted death rates is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist293.htm.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: \u201cAre you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs. To access the latest BRFSS data, (2013-2017) view the Behavioral Risk Factors \u2013 Vision and Eye Health Surveillance dataset (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Vision-Eye-Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factors-Vision-and-Eye-Health-Surv/vkwg-yswv).",

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.
